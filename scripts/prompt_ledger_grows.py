"""The prompt version ledger only grows: nothing the base branch recorded is
changed or removed (#424).

    python scripts/prompt_ledger_grows.py --base origin/release/1.7

`evals/prompt-versions.json` records every version each prompt has declared
and the one text it had, as a fingerprint (#236). `tests/test_prompt_fingerprint_file.py`
holds it equal to the registry, but it compares the code with the ledger AS
COMMITTED IN THE SAME CHANGE, so an edit that changes a prompt's text at its
version and rewrites that version's recorded fingerprint passes it. That is
#117's shape with the guard's expected side edited to agree (1d on #422). This
compares the ledger with the BASE branch's, which the change cannot edit.

**Exit codes, and why there are three.** 0 the ledger only grew; 1 something
recorded on the base was changed or removed, each named; 2 **no answer**: the
base does not resolve, so nothing was compared. A check that passes on a base
it could not read is worse than the review it replaces (policyforge-b5 on
#422), so 2 is a failure, never a pass. A base that resolves and holds NO
ledger (a branch from before #236) is a readable fact, not a missing answer:
there is nothing recorded to hold, and it says so rather than passing quietly.

**Against the branch point, not the base's tip** (policyforge-ba on #435).
The ledger is compared with `git merge-base HEAD <base>`. Run locally on
a branch whose base has since grown, the tip holds versions this branch
never saw, and comparing with it reported them "removed here": a false
alarm, and a check that cries wolf gets ignored. In CI the checkout is
the pull request's merge commit, whose merge-base with the base IS the
tip, so CI's answer does not change.

CI checks out the pull request with full history (`fetch-depth: 0`), so
`origin/<base>` exists; run locally, fetch first.
