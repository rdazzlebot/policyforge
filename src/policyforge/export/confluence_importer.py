"""Pull an existing page's content back out of Confluence, converting its
storage format (XHTML) back to this project's canonical markdown — the
reverse of confluence_exporter.py's markdown_to_confluence /
export_to_confluence.

Two things this exists for:
- Bootstrapping: bring a policy that already lives in Confluence (written
  by hand before this tool existed) into the pipeline so it can be tracked
  going forward — see history/version_store.py.
- Drift detection: `cli.py`'s `import-confluence` command records the
  imported content into the *same* version stream as `generate` for that
  tier/name, so you can diff "what this tool last generated" against
  "what's actually live" in case someone hand-edited the published page.

Conversion is not guaranteed lossless for Confluence-native macros beyond
the `code` macro this project's own exporter emits (see
`_restore_code_fences`) — round-trip fidelity is only guaranteed for
documents this tool itself published. A panel, expand block, or page
property macro will pass through as raw HTML rather than vanishing or
crashing, but it won't come back as clean markdown either.

Reading a *foreign* page — one a team hand-wrote years before this tool
existed — asks more of the conversion than round-tripping our own does, and
that is what `_restore_links` is for. Confluence writes cross-page links,
user mentions and images as `<ac:link>` / `<ac:image>` elements whose payload
lives entirely in attributes, so markdownify, which knows only HTML, renders
them as *nothing at all*: a page-properties row reading `Owner: @Jane`
arrives as an empty table cell, and "see the Access Review Procedure"
arrives as "see .". For the existing use — drift detection against documents
this tool published, which contain none of those elements — that never
mattered. For anything that reads someone else's page and answers questions
about it, a silently blank owner is worse than a missing one, because it
reads as an answer.
