"""Common shape every framework loader normalizes into.

Keeping ingest/*.py loaders separate from this schema is what lets bundled
(public-domain) sources and BYOC (licensed) sources flow through the same
mapping/synthesis/generate pipeline without the pipeline code caring where
a Control came from.

Two sub-requirement shapes live here, and the difference is not cosmetic:

* **`ControlEnhancement`** is *additive*. NIST 800-53's AC-2(1) is AC-2
  plus something more; an assessor reads both. Selecting an enhancement is
  a decision about rigour, made once per baseline.
* **`Requirement`** is *alternative*. HITRUST CSF states a control once as
  a short specification and then re-states it as a full requirement per
  **level** — Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, but also Level HIPAA, Level
  FedRAMP, Level CMS and sixty-odd other regulatory and segment overlays.
  Which levels apply to you is not a rigour dial; it is computed from your
  organization's scoping factors (bed count, records held, whether you
  touch federal tax information). Two organizations assessed against the
  same control reference can be answering entirely different text.

Modelling HITRUST levels as enhancements was the tempting shortcut and it
is wrong in a way that corrupts reports: it would make "Level HIPAA" look
like extra credit on top of Level 1 rather than a parallel statement
selected by a regulatory factor, and coverage counts would double-count
every control that carries an overlay.
