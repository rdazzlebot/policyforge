"""The provider an eval run measures, built the way production builds one.

Every command obtains its provider from `policyforge.llm.base.get_provider`,
which builds the configured provider and wraps it in the call ledger. The
eval harness did not: `scripts/eval_zardoz.py --model` constructed a
`LiteLLMProvider` directly and metered that. Two construction paths meant
two request shapes, and when the ledger wrapper silently hid every
`supports_*` flag, the harness kept sending effort while the CLI did not.
Epochs 15 through 19 in `MEASUREMENTS.md` describe a request production
never made, and nothing could have said so, because nothing compared the
two paths.

So there is one path. `eval_config` turns the run's options — a model
string, a request interval — into overrides on the same config dict
production reads, and `build_provider` hands that dict to `get_provider`
and meters the result. A `--model` flag is a config override, not a second
constructor, and `tests/test_eval_provider_parity.py` holds the two paths
to the same provider class, the same flags and the same effort, caching
and grounding decisions.

**Eval calls go to their own ledger file**, `evals.jsonl` beside the
production one, and every case is recorded under `<suite>/<case>` with the
site `eval`. They are real calls that were billed and that carried the
eval corpora to a vendor, so they belong in a ledger; they are not the
organization's documents, so they do not belong in the one that answers
"which documents did that model touch".
