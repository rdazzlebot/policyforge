"""C-01 — no endpoint this project contacts is undeclared.

`docs/commitments.md` states that PolicyForge contacts nothing the operator
did not configure: no telemetry, no analytics, no licence check, no update
ping. That is the commitment an adopter is least able to verify for
themselves and most wants verified — a compliance tool that quietly reported
usage would be a finding in its own generated Standards.

Prose is the wrong form for it. The claim is true today because nobody has
added a `requests.post` to a metrics endpoint, and it stays true only while
somebody keeps not doing that. A reviewer reading a diff sees a new URL
constant and has no way to know whether it was always there.

So the allowlist below is the declaration, and this test is the enforcement:
every host-shaped literal in `src/` is either in it, with a stated reason, or
the test fails and names the file. Adding an endpoint is then a deliberate
act that edits this file, which is exactly the review conversation that
should happen.

Read over the parsed AST rather than by grepping the text, so a module stays
free to *discuss* an endpoint in its docstring — which several do, since
explaining where public catalog content comes from is part of their job.

What this does not prove: that a dependency contacts nothing. That is what
the hashed lockfile, pip-audit and the seven-day Dependabot cooldown are
for, and it is a different claim with different evidence.
