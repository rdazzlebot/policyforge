"""A run ends with what it cost, said once (#379), by one rule (80's ruling).

The rule, for this summary, the provenance stamp and `policyforge ledger`'s
totals: a total is a total only when every call is priced; otherwise the
known part and the count of calls of unknown cost are both said, and never
merged. A local model's call is priced at 0.0 by its boundary class.
Measured before this: 6 of 27 session ledgers mixed priced and unpriced calls,
and every total over them presented the known part as the whole.
