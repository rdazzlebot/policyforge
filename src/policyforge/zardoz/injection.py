"""Passages that read as instructions to the answerer rather than as evidence.

Zardoz answers from text it retrieved out of a document corpus, and
`zardoz.supporting_space` deliberately admits pages nobody has declared
ownership of. That text goes into the same request as the rules governing
how it should be used. For a tool whose output an assessor may rely on, a
passage read as instruction rather than as evidence means somebody is told
something false about their own control posture — and told it in the voice
of their own policy set.

`answer.py` holds the structural half of the answer: every passage is
fenced with a per-request token no document can contain, so the model is
told unambiguously where quoted material starts and stops. This module is
the other half, and it is a *report on the corpus*, not a check on the
answer. The distinction matters. A warning at sync time arrives when
somebody can still go and look at the page; the same warning attached to an
answer arrives too late to act on and trains its reader to click past it.

**Why this is not an imperative detector.** The obvious approach — flag
commanding language — is useless on this corpus and would be actively
harmful. A security policy set is imperative from end to end: "Accounts
must be recertified quarterly", "Do not share credentials", "Revoke the
badge, then close the account". Those are the content. A detector firing on
them would report every document in the corpus, which is the same as
reporting nothing.

What separates an injected instruction from a requirement is not mood but
*audience*. A requirement addresses the organization's staff. An injection
addresses whoever is reading the prompt, and to do that it has to reach for
vocabulary a policy document has no reason to use: the prompt itself, the
rules, the assistant, the model, or this system's own control tokens. That
is what is matched here.

**This is a heuristic and is documented as one.** It catches the phrasings
somebody reaches for first, not every phrasing that could work; a patient
attacker writes around any word list, and a list long enough to stop one
would flag ordinary prose. It is worth having anyway, because the realistic
case is not a patient attacker — it is a runbook somebody pasted an
LLM conversation into, or a page written to steer a chatbot the team was
experimenting with last year. The fence in `answer.py` is the part that
holds; this is the part that tells you to go and look.
