"""Making a follow-up question mean what it obviously means.

This is the milestone that makes Zardoz a conversation rather than a search
box with a prompt. The questions people actually have about a policy set
arrive in chains — *what's our access review cadence?*, then *who owns
that?*, then *does it satisfy the HIPAA citation?* — and only the first of
those can be answered on its own. "who owns that?" retrieved literally is
one content word against a corpus of governance documents: it finds
nothing, and the honest refusal it earns is useless, because the question
was perfectly clear to any human reading the exchange.

Resolution happens before retrieval rather than inside answering, and that
ordering is the whole design. Retrieval is keyword scoring; it has no
mechanism for "that" and never will. Handing the answering model the
conversation and hoping it works out which passages *would* have been
relevant is the alternative, and it fails silently — the model answers from
whatever it was given, and nobody can tell that the right section was never
fetched. Rewriting the question first means the failure is visible in the
one place a reader can check it.

**A rewritten question is always shown.** Zardoz resolving "who owns that?"
into "who owns the access review cadence requirement?" is a guess about
intent, and a good one is indistinguishable from a bad one once the answer
is written. So the resolved question is printed above the answer: if the
guess was wrong, the reader sees a plausible answer to a question they did
not ask, which is exactly the situation the rest of this package exists to
make visible rather than to prevent.

Rules:

1. Substitute only what the conversation actually establishes. "who owns
   that?" after a question about access review cadence becomes "who owns
   the access review cadence?" — not "who owns access control", which is a
   broader subject nobody raised.
2. Keep the user's own words wherever they still work. You are resolving
   references, not improving phrasing, and a rewrite that swaps the user's
   terms for synonyms will retrieve different documents.
3. If the question already stands alone, return it exactly as given. Most
   questions do.
4. Never answer the question, and never add facts. You are producing a
   search query, and a detail you supplied rather than the user is a detail
   the documents will be searched for and may well contain — giving a
   confident answer to a question nobody asked.
5. Keep control identifiers (AC-2, 164.312(a)(1)) exactly as written."""
