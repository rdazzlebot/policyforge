"""After cutting a tag: does what a user installs match what you released?

Every check in this repository looks *inside* the repository. On 2026-09-19
three sessions declared 1.4.0 done — the tag was right, the version triple
agreed, the changelog was correct, the gate was green, the release notes
were published — and for roughly three hours `brew install
rdazzlebot/tap/policyforge`, the first command in this project's own README
(the tap has since moved to `rdazzleman`),
installed **1.3.0**. Every individual check passed. None of them looked at
the artefact a user receives.

That release was the one adding the `etl-hipaa` guard, so anyone installing
in that window got the build where running `etl-hipaa` on its own silently
rewrote their catalog from 65 crosswalk mappings to 0 and reported nothing
wrong. The tag is not the deliverable. For anyone following the README, the
tap is.

Four assertions, in the order they fail:

1. The published formula's `url` names the tag just cut.
1b. ...and its `sha256` matches the archive that URL actually serves. A
    formula can name the right tag beside a stale hash, and then every
    install fails at verification while assertion 1 reports it correct.
2. The formula's pinned resource versions match the lock at that tag.
3. `changelog.d/` is empty — no fragment survived the release.
4. A user can actually install it — `brew install --build-from-source` in
   a clean container, then the CLI runs.

**Assertion 4 exists because this script was the substitution.** The
recorded procedure was: verify in a container BEFORE pushing the formula.
What happened at 1.6.0 was push → run this script → call it done, and the
formula was live and unverified for the whole gap. The container run
afterwards passed, which is not the point: it ran because the user asked
*"don't you usually run a docker test after cutting a release?"*

This script reads the formula and compares values. **It never installed
anything.** Those are different questions, and the cheap one stood in for
the one that matters — so the fix is that the cheap one can no longer
report success on its own. A skipped step leaves a gap; a substituted step
leaves a false assurance, which is worse.

Assertion 4 is SKIPPABLE and skipping it FAILS unless you say so, the same
contract `scripts/check.py` uses for gitleaks: a check nobody ran must not
look like a check that passed.

**Every one compares values and prints them, and none reads an exit
status.** That is not stylistic. On the same night a Homebrew build failed
while its harness reported success, because the shell returns the status of
the *last* command in a sequence and that was `tail`; `set -o pipefail`
protects a pipe and has no opinion about `cmd; echo; tail`. A release step
that shells out and trusts `$?` inherits exactly that. So does one that
exits quietly on success — a step nobody can tell ran is the gate defect
this project already fixed once, wearing different clothes.

Run it after pushing the tap, not before: it fetches the *published*
formula, because the question is what a user gets rather than what is in
your working copy.
