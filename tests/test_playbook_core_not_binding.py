"""A Core citation does not exempt a Playbook sentence from the gate (#341).

The AI RMF Core states outcomes, not obligations, so citing it beside the
Playbook does not make a sentence binding. Only a catalog that states
obligations (800-53, HIPAA, ...) hands a sentence to the strength rule.
80's ruling, with hand-written sentences: glm's "Playbook + Core" sentences
turned out to be analyzer merges across headings (#349), not real cases.
