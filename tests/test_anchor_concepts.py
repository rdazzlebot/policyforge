"""Two meanings of "anchor", kept apart on purpose.

    NIST_ANCHOR     the CROSSWALK anchor - what every other framework's
                    requirements are mapped ONTO. Singular.
    TOPIC_ANCHORS   which catalogs a TOPIC may claim identifiers from.
                    A set.

They were one constant until 2026-09-20. **The reason to split them is
that the obvious way to let topics anchor a second catalog — grep
`NIST_ANCHOR`, widen it — also widens the crosswalk-anchor sites**, and a
catalog that becomes a crosswalk target becomes one `crosswalk seed` will
generate a mapping for.

For the NIST AI RMF that mapping is refused on product grounds: it would
assert an 800-53 control *achieves* an AI RMF outcome, the claim NIST
declined to make when it split the Playbook out. So the natural refactor
publishes the thing the project decided not to publish, while looking
exactly like the change that was asked for.

These tests make that impossible rather than discouraged.

#: could not see it, and the anchor resolution stayed hardcoded to 800-53.
#:
#: The cost was not theoretical: every AI topic resolved to ZERO controls
#: while `/coverage` reported those same topics owning 91 requirements. Two
#: views of one registry disagreeing, with only one of them user-facing.
#:
#: Found by policyforge-80, who had reviewed and approved the enumeration --
#: **it was checkable, and checking the files is not the same as checking
#: the concepts.** The residual this leaves is named rather than closed: a
#: file can still consume the crosswalk without naming the constant, so
#: `test_ai_topics_resolve_to_their_own_controls` guards the behaviour
#: directly rather than relying on the lists below.

#: `mapping/crosswalk.py` is excluded from the "must not mention the topic
#: anchor" guard for one stated reason: **it is where both constants are
#: defined.** It necessarily names them.
#:
#: Written as a visible exclusion rather than by quietly dropping it from
#: the tuple, because a guard that states its own reach can be wrong out
#: loud. The residual it leaves: a genuine A-side *misuse* inside the
#: definition module would not be caught here. `_is_nist` there is the one
#: consumer, and `test_the_crosswalk_offers_only_the_anchor_as_a_target`
#: covers it behaviourally.
