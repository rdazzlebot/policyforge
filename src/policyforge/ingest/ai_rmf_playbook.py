"""The NIST AI RMF Playbook -- NIST's suggested actions, per Core subcategory.

**The Playbook is VOLUNTARY, and that is the first thing to know about
citing it.** NIST: *"The Playbook is neither a checklist nor set of steps to
be followed in its entirety. Playbook suggestions are voluntary."* A
document citing an action here may say NIST *suggests* it and never that
NIST *requires* it (80's ruling on #177). The catalog README says so first.

**Why this catalog exists.** The AI RMF Core (`ai_rmf.py`) states outcomes,
not obligations, and NIST deliberately put the actions in this separately
versioned Playbook instead. Decomposing an outcome into actions ourselves
would assert something NIST withheld; ingesting NIST's own suggestions is
the one route to actions that invents nothing (#177).

**Shape.** One Control per Core subcategory (`Govern 1.1` ...), titled with
OUR label ("Suggested actions for GOVERN 1.1"), and one enhancement per
suggested action (`Govern 1.1 Action 3`). No outcome wording is carried: the
export restates each outcome, and in 38 of 72 its wording differs from the
AI RMF 1.0 Core's (observed on #177), so the outcome is read from
`nist-ai-rmf` under the same id (80's ruling). The action NUMBER is ours -- its position in
NIST's list -- because NIST does not number them; the README says so. Every
Control's id must be a subcategory the shipped Core carries: an action with
no subcategory is refused, not filed.

**What counts as an action** is a TOP-LEVEL item of a subcategory's
Suggested Actions list -- the definition both of `policyforge-f8`'s
instruments applied on #177 (Markdown indentation, and NIST's own rendered
DOM), which agreed on every subcategory. Nested sub-items are enumerations
inside an action and stay part of its text. A line before the first item is
a lead-in ("Organizational management can:"), kept as the subcategory's
discussion. A column-0 line after an item that is not itself an item --
MANAGE 2.2's malformed `-Establish ...`, which repeats the line above it --
is a CommonMark lazy continuation of that item, and is kept in its text
exactly as NIST's renderer shows it. Accepting it as an item gives 460,
which is the number to distrust.

**Pinned, twice.** NIST publishes no revision number for the Playbook (its
FAQ: *"there will not be a 'final version'"*), so the revision this catalog
asserts is the SHA-256 of the export itself, and a different export is
REFUSED, not parsed: a catalog pinned to a revision refuses to ingest a
different one (standing ruling). The extent is pinned too, per subcategory,
to an independent count -- not to anything this parser produced.
