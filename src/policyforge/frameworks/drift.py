"""What a framework update actually changed, and what it costs you.

A catalog bumps version and the honest question is not "what is different"
— a diff answers that and is unreadable — but **"what do I have to go and
look at?"**. Rev 5.1.1 to 5.2.0 touches a few dozen controls out of a
thousand. Somewhere behind those sits a handful of your topics, a smaller
handful of your published documents, and possibly a parameter you decided on
the strength of wording that has since moved. Everything else is unaffected
and should stay unread.

Without that scoping the two available responses are both wrong. Re-generate
the whole document set, and you throw away every hand edit and every review
that ever happened to it. Change nothing, and the documents quietly stop
matching the catalog they cite. What makes the difference is a blast radius
you can trust, which is why this walks all the way through to *documents*
rather than stopping at control identifiers.

The workflow it is built for is the repo-backed one. `etl-oscal` overwrites
the catalog in place; git still holds the version you had. So the default
comparison is the working copy against the committed one, and "slurp up the
update" is two commands with a report in between:

    policyforge etl-oscal
    policyforge drift --controls data/frameworks/nist-800-53-r5/controls.json

**Not every change is worth reading.** A reworded discussion paragraph is
not a new obligation, so changes are separated by what they touch: the
control statement is the requirement and warrants review, while discussion,
title and related-control edits are noted and kept out of the way. Treating
them alike is how a drift report becomes something people skim past.

    Walks the content tree rather than the corpus, because the question is
    which *files you maintain* need re-reading, and those are the ones under
    review in a pull request.

    **Document reach, the broader of the two breadths** (`topics.anchoring`,
    80's ruling on #377): a change reaches every document citing the same
    family **in the change's own framework**. A document citing AC-2(3) is
    reached by a change to AC-2(1), because a reader re-checking one part
    of AC-2 has to re-check the control; `Govern 1.3` reaches `Govern 1`
    and every `Govern 1.x`; a Playbook action reaches Playbook citations of
    its subcategory and never the Core's. Missing a document is the
    dangerous direction, so this reaches wider than topic ownership does.

    **Across catalogs, through the 800-53 hub** (80's ruling (ii) on #377):
    every citation stands for 800-53 families, its own if it cites 800-53,
    otherwise those the loaded crosswalk maps it to in full, and a change
    reaches a document whose citation shares one with it. `crosswalk` is
    `build_crosswalk` over the catalogs actually loaded.

    **Each citation is resolved before it is matched** (80's ruling on
    #418), because a citation `check` accepts is one a document really
    writes, and 1d measured four that the first version dropped in silence:

    - a framework-name variant (`[NIST SP 800-53 AC-2(3)]`, `[NIST 800-53
      Rev 5 AC-2(3)]`): the words the tag splitter left on the id are taken
      back into the name, longest first, while the rest still resolves;
    - a statement part (`AC-6(1)(a)`): trailing parts come off until the
      catalog has the id;
    - an id a catalog does not carry, in a catalog whose crosswalk maps
      every id to 800-53's same id (FedRAMP, ARC-AMPE, derived from the
      data, never listed): 800-53's own, as (B) reaches them;
    - an abbreviation naming two loaded catalogs (`NIST`): each of them
      through which this change reaches the cited id.

    **What still does not resolve is reached by 800-53 id shape, for
    documents only, and says so.** Every 800-53-shaped id in its text
    counts by its 800-53 family, the way every document was reached before
    #377, and the document is marked `BY_SHAPE` so drift prints it as
    reached by shape: partial success is allowed only when it is loud, and
    the citation is then fixed where it is written. Topic reach never uses
    this; ownership is not inferred from a shape.

    `catalogs` is `{catalog key: every id it has}` for the catalogs loaded,
    which is what "the catalog has the id" is asked of. Without it only the
    diffed catalog's ids and the crosswalk's are known.
