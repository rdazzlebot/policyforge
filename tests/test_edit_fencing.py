"""S-01 — the write path must not take orders from the page it is editing.

The read path solved this: retrieved passages sit between a per-request
token no document can contain, and the turn says in as many words that
everything between the markers is quoted material. The write path inlined
the live page with `f"Current document:\n\n{document}"` and inherited none
of it — on the one path that publishes back to the live policy set.

Three things are tested here, because the fix has three parts and each fails
differently:

* **The fence**, in `edit/fencing.py`. Structural. A page cannot place itself
  outside the markers, so its text is quoted rather than obeyed.
* **The scan**, at the CLI. A report, not a control: it tells somebody to go
  and look at the page before anything is spent on a model call.
* **The check**, in `check_edit`. Losses were flagged and additions were not,
  so a requirement inserted into a section nobody planned came back clean.
  That is exactly the shape a successful injection takes.

No test makes a network call; Confluence and the provider are faked.
