"""The model channels that are not LLM providers, held to the same boundary.

`get_provider` wraps every language-model call in the ledger, and every
command that reads a file classifies it before a model sees it. Two other
channels send the organization's text to a model and did neither: the
embedder posts passages to `embed.base_url`, and the reranker posts a query
and passages to `rerank.base_url`. Both default to this machine and both are
off unless configured — and both would carry the policy corpus to a hosted
endpoint the moment someone pointed `base_url` at one, unclassified and
unrecorded. That is the one thing the ledger's guarantee says cannot happen.

A `Channel` is that guarantee for a URL-addressed service. It classifies the
endpoint the way `classify_provider` classifies an `llm:` block, admits a
batch only when the content in scope may reach it, and writes one ledger
record per batch: the count and a hash of the texts, never the texts.

What it does not do is add those records to the document's provenance. The
scope a document is drafted in lists the models that *wrote* it, and an
embedding model wrote nothing; counting it there would name a model in the
one answer that has to be exact.
