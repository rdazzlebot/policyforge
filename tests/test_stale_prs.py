"""The queue check fires on the state that produced the ten hours, and on no other.

Written against the incident rather than against the idea of one: on
2026-09-19 a pull request sat `CLEAN` with zero pending checks for ten
hours while being listed in status reports as "other sessions' work" — a
fact about whose branch it is, read as a fact about whose turn it is.

The risk in a check like this is not missing that case. It is firing on the
four states that look similar and are someone's turn — checks running,
review outstanding, a conflict, a draft. A queue check that nags is one
people stop reading, and then the queue has no owner again with a script
running over it.
