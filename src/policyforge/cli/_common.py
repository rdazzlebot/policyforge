    `history` and `import-confluence` build their storage path as

    through `slugify` first. These two did not, so `--name ../../../../tmp/x`
    resolved outside the history store entirely (verified: it wrote to
    `C:\\tmp\\pwned\\index.jsonl`), and `--name ..\\..\\evil` climbed out of

    This is a local CLI, so the realistic case is a mistake rather than an
    attacker — a name pasted with a stray path on the front, quietly writing
    a version stream somewhere nobody will look for it again. Rejecting is
    better than slugifying silently: a name that is not what this tool would
    have written is a name the caller should see corrected, not have guessed
    at, because the corrected form is the one they must type next time to
    read the history back.

# ---- the config and provider seam -----------------------------------------
#
# Every command reads config and builds a provider through these two, never by
# importing `policyforge.config` or `policyforge.llm.base` itself. They resolve
# `policyforge.cli.load_config` and `policyforge.cli.get_provider` at call time.
#
# That is what kept the split from being a silent hazard. Fifty-eight test
# sites substitute a fake config and a fake provider by patching those two
# names on `policyforge.cli`. A command that imported the real functions into
# its own module would stop seeing the patch, and a test that believed it was
# talking to a fake would build a real provider instead. One place to
# substitute, looked up when it is used, keeps the tests' contract true for
# every command wherever it lives.
