"""Generation prompts must teach a citation form that actually resolves.

Prompts teach by example, and the example was `[NIST IA-5 | GovRAMP IA-5]`.
After the NIST-family key split, `NIST` alone keys to the shared `nist`
bucket: it resolves while one NIST catalog is loaded and becomes a reported
unknown the moment a second joins. `NIST 800-53` keys to `nist-800-53` and
resolves either way.

So the example a model copies decides whether the documents it writes keep
resolving when a user brings 800-171 or the CSF. Nothing else checks this:
a prompt is a string, every test passes with any string in it, and the
failure appears later as unresolved citations in generated documents.

The split that matters is narrower than it looks, and these tests pin that
too — `HIPAA` and `HIPAA Security Rule` both key to `hipaa`, as do
`GovRAMP` and `GovRAMP Moderate`. NIST is the only family where qualifying
the name changes what it resolves to, so it is the only part of the example
that had to move.
