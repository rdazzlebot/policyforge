"""The registry, and the specific failure it was built for.

A measured run against `kimi-k3` was half finished when two commits changed
the edit planner and the clusterer. The run had imported the old modules at
process start, so it measured code that no longer existed, and nothing in
the run or its report could have said so — it was caught by a person
comparing file mtimes against a log's birth time. These tests pin the
mechanism that makes noticing unnecessary.
