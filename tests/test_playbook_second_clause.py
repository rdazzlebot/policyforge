"""A Playbook sentence has one main clause, NIST's (#323, 80's ruling (B)).

`playbook_obligations` passed "NIST suggests reviewing the inventory, and Acme
will adopt it": the subject check reads the start, and `classify` does not
count "will" as binding. 1d found it reviewing #322.

80's first ruling -- any clause after a joiner must begin with NIST -- was
measured before building and refused 65 of b5's 66 real glm sentences,
because glm writes lists ("...; establishing ...", "..., and stakeholder
engagement plans"). It was withdrawn. The rule now refuses an ORGANIZATION
actor after a joiner: a closed generic list, plus the organization's own name,
teams and vendors from its config.

**The real corpus:** `fixtures/playbook_glm_run301_sentences.md` holds every
Playbook-only sentence from b5's stored #301 glm Standards (run301 and
run301b, 5 files, 66 sentences), one per paragraph, with any tag that sat on
the next line appended. Replayed here with no model call.
