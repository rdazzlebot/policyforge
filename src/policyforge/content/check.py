"""The gate a pull request has to pass before anything reaches the wiki.

Everything here is local and offline. That is the point: these are the
mistakes worth catching *before* a publish, and a check that needed
credentials could not run on a fork's pull request, which is exactly where
you want it running.

The failures it looks for are the ones that are invisible in review. A
reviewer reading a diff sees the prose change and not that two files now
claim the same Confluence page, that a link points at a file somebody
renamed, or that a rewrite dropped the `[NIST AC-2 | HIPAA 164.308(a)(3)(i)]`
tag that was the document's only traceability back to the control it
implements. Each of those survives review comfortably and then fails at
publish time, or worse, does not fail at all.

Errors and warnings are separated because they need different answers. Two
documents pointing at one page will publish one over the other and lose
work, so it stops the build. A document with no declared owner is a gap
worth seeing on every run and not worth blocking a merge over — a repo
mid-migration is full of them, and a gate that cannot be satisfied gets
switched off.
