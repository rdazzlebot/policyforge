"""Every command reaches config and the provider through one seam.

The CLI tests substitute a fake config and a fake provider by patching
`policyforge.cli.load_config` and `policyforge.cli.get_provider` — fifty-eight
sites. That works only if commands look those names up through
`policyforge.cli` when they run. When cli.py was one module, that was
automatic. Split into a package, a command module that wrote

    from policyforge.llm.base import get_provider

would bind the real function into its own globals, the patch would stop
reaching it, and a test that believed it was talking to a fake would build a
real provider instead — against a real endpoint, if a key were present.

`policyforge/cli/_common.py` defines the seam and every command module
imports from it. This test makes that a rule rather than a habit.
