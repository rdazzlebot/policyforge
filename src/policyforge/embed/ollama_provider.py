"""Embeds text with a model served by Ollama's `/api/embed`.

Chosen because it needs nothing new. A machine already running Ollama for
generation can serve `bge-m3` alongside it — no second process, unlike the
reranker, and no PyTorch. `ollama pull bge-m3` is the whole installation.

The endpoint returns 501 rather than 404 when the named model cannot
embed, which is easy to misread as "Ollama does not do embeddings". It
does; `llama3.2` just is not an embedding model. `check()` below turns that
into a sentence that says so.

Every batch goes through a `Channel`: checked against the boundary before it
is sent, and recorded in the ledger once it has been. A batch is a slice of
the organization's policy corpus, and pointing `embed.base_url` at a hosted
endpoint used to send it there with no check and no record.
