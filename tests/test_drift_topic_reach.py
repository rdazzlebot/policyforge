"""A changed control reaches the topics its catalog's rule says it does (#339).

`assess_impact` claimed "the same rule coverage.py uses" and used the
800-53 grammar (`AC-2(3)` -> `AC-2`) for every catalog, so an AI RMF
subcategory change (`Govern 1.1`) reached no topic anchoring its category
(`Govern 1`). Now an anchored catalog (800-53, the AI RMF Core) uses
coverage's own `parent_of`; the Playbook, whose ids read like the Core's,
reaches no topic; any other catalog keeps the rule it had.

The framework names are the shipped catalogs' own, never typed here.
