"""How strongly a document states its requirements, and whether that
strength survived the trip from the control that justifies it.

An assessor does not read `must` and `should` as variations in tone. One is
a commitment the organization can be held to and the other is an intention,
and a Standard full of the second is not auditable. The source controls are
written in obligation language — 800-53 says an organization *shall* — so a
generated Standard that renders a cited requirement as "teams should
consider recertifying" has quietly downgraded a control while still
displaying its citation. The document looks correct, cites correctly, and
promises less than the framework it claims to satisfy.

That is the finding this module exists for, and it is narrower than
counting modal verbs. A `should` on its own is often right: a Policy states
principles, a Standard's commentary can advise, and flagging every one of
them would bury the case that matters under noise nobody reads — the same
trap `zardoz/answer.py` keeps warning about with its integrity checks.
What is reported is a sentence that carries a framework citation and does
not bind.

Deterministic on purpose. Every grader in this project is a substring, a
pattern or a rule, for the reason `evals/runner.py` gives: a checker that
needed a model would have the failure mode it exists to detect.

    the kind of false positive that teaches people to ignore the check.
