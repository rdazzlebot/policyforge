"""The floating head, and every other line of Zardoz-flavoured chrome.

All of the persona lives in this one module, deliberately. Zardoz answers
questions about what an organization's security documents actually require,
and those answers have to read as plainly as the documents themselves — a
requirement someone pastes into a ticket or shows an assessor cannot arrive
wrapped in theatre. So the voice is confined to the *shell chrome*: the
launch banner, the help header, the goodbye, and the "I don't know that
word" line. Nothing here is ever mixed into a substantive answer.

Keeping it in one file is what makes that hold. If flavour strings were
sprinkled through the shell and the answering code, the line between chrome
and content would blur within a few commits; here the boundary is a module
import, and turning the persona off is one flag rather than a scavenger hunt.

The art is deliberately 7-bit ASCII. Block-drawing characters look sharper
in a modern terminal, but they render as mojibake in a classic `cmd.exe`
code page, and the first thing anyone sees on launch is a bad place to
discover an encoding problem. `HEAD` is a raw string so the backslashes
drawing the head's left cheek stay literal instead of becoming line
continuations.
