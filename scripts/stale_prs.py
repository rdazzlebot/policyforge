"""Report pull requests that are ready to merge and have not been.

On 2026-09-19 a pull request sat `CLEAN` with zero pending checks for **ten
hours**. Nothing was wrong with it. It was approved, green, and mergeable,
and the release manager — whose role is to merge anyone's pull request —
listed it in three separate status reports as "open, other sessions' work".

That phrase is a fact about whose *branch* it is. It was filed as a fact
about whose *turn* it is. The two read identically and mean opposite things.

**The failure has no artefact, which is why it needs a check rather than a
habit.** A forgotten extension point fails the first time someone uses it. A
queue nobody polls produces no signal at all: green accumulates, every check
passes, and there is nothing to be red. Every pull request that moved that
day had been handed over by name and moved within minutes; the one nobody
announced was invisible, because the queue was only ever examined when
something arrived.

So this asks the question nobody was asking — *what is ready that nobody has
picked up?* — and answers it with names and durations rather than a count, so
the output is a worklist instead of a nag.

**A draft is not stale.** Neither is one waiting on checks, on review, or on
a conflict: each of those is someone's turn and the queue is working. Only
`CLEAN` with nothing pending means *the machine has no further objection and
a person has not acted*, which is the state that produced the ten hours.

Prints what it examined either way, including on a clean run, because a
check that goes quiet when it passes is indistinguishable from one that did
not run — the defect #112 fixed in the gate, which this would otherwise
reintroduce in a new file.

THE STEP BEFORE (#178). Ready-and-unmerged is the LAST place finished work
waits. It was built at the point that last hurt, which is one step below the
next place things pile up: a pull request nobody has read. #161 sat two
hours with no comment and nobody named, while a status report called the
queue healthy because every PR was green. So two more questions:

    UNREAD           open, not a draft, and no verdict line at all -- or
                     none at the current head, because an approval does not
                     survive a new commit. Over the threshold, it fails.
    PUSHED, NO PR    a branch on the remote with no pull request of any
                     state. Reported and never failed: parking finished
                     work on the remote without a PR is a legitimate thing
                     to do, and a check that fails on it forever is one
                     people stop reading. It is shown so it is a choice
                     someone can see, not a branch nobody remembers.

Verdict lines are read with `review_lines.verdict_lines` -- the same parser
the verdict reader uses -- so the two tools cannot disagree about what a
review is. "Read" means a `Reviewed-SHA:` line exists, not that anyone was
ASKED; being asked has no artefact, and a verdict line is the nearest one.
