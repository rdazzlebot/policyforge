"""One decided value per organization-defined parameter, and why.

SP 800-53 Rev 5 does not tell you how often to review accounts. It says
`[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]` and leaves the number to you
— 1,210 times across the catalog this project ships, counting statements and
enhancements. Every one of those is a decision somebody has to make and
defend, and today they get made implicitly, inside generated prose, by a
model that has no memory of what it chose for the neighbouring control.

That produces documents that are individually plausible and collectively
indefensible. The Access Control Standard says quarterly, the Audit
Standard says "periodically", the SSP says annually, and nobody decided
anything — three drafts did. An assessor asking "why quarterly?" gets no
answer, because there isn't one.

The ledger makes each value a *recorded decision*:

    AC-2/frequency:
      value: quarterly
      rationale: >-
        HITRUST 01.c specifies quarterly for account review; 800-53 leaves it
        organization-defined, so the stricter framework governs.
      source: HITRUST CSF 01.c

Three properties follow, and they are the whole point:

* **One decision, many documents.** The value is substituted into control
  text before synthesis, so every document drawn from that control says the
  same thing, and so does the SSP. Consistency stops being something to
  check for and becomes something that cannot fail.
* **The reasoning survives.** "Why quarterly" is the question asked a year
  later, by an assessor or by whoever inherits the programme, and the answer
  belongs next to the value rather than in someone's memory.
* **Undecided is visible.** A parameter with no decision stays as
  `[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]` in the output, which reads
  as the gap it is. That is better than a number nobody chose.

**On keys.** A parameter is identified by its control and its label —
`AC-2/frequency`, `AU-6/personnel-or-roles` — rather than by the OSCAL
identifier (`ac-02_odp.01`) that NIST assigns. The OSCAL ids are more
durable across rewordings and this project's loader currently discards them,
but the deciding factor is who reads this file: a human filling in a hundred
values needs to see which control and which quantity, and `ac-02_odp.04`
tells them neither. The durability cost is handled rather than ignored — a
key that no longer matches any parameter is reported as stale rather than
silently dropped, so a catalog rewording surfaces as a question instead of a
lost decision.
