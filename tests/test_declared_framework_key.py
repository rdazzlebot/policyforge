"""A catalog keys by the `framework_id:` its `framework.yaml` declares (#295, PR 1 of 2).

`normalize_framework` keyed a framework by the first word of its prose name
unless an alias needle matched first, and every sibling of a pinned name fell
through to the bare word (#176 recorded seven). 80's ruling: a declared key in
`framework.yaml` (`framework_id:`, not `key:`, which gitleaks reads as a
secret); the declaration wins; a tree-derived test that each shipped
catalog's declared key equals today's key, so this change moves no key; and a
disagreement for a shipped catalog is a test failure.

**Read from the directories, not registered at load** (80's condition): a
name keyed before any catalog is loaded -- a citation parsed first -- must
still get the declared key.
