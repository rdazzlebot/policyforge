"""Delete one prompt rule at a time and see which eval cases notice.

    python scripts/mutate_zardoz.py --suite routing
    python scripts/mutate_zardoz.py --suite answering --rule 6
    python scripts/mutate_zardoz.py --dry-run

The eval suite measures the model. This measures the eval suite. A rule
nothing catches is unguarded: either it does not do anything and should be
deleted, or the cases have a hole exactly where their evidence should be.

Both answers have shown up already. Stripping the grounding rules from the
answering prompt left every refusal case green, because half of them
retrieved nothing and never called the model at all.

A baseline runs first, and a case counts as guarding a rule only if it
passed clean and failed mutated. Without that, a flaky case reads as
evidence for whichever rule happened to be removed when it misfired.

One rule at a time cannot see a rule that another rule repeats. The
router's "prefer documents" and "if unsure, say documents" both survive
their own deletion and neither is dead weight: removing both misroutes an
ambiguous question every time. `--pairs` retries the survivors two at a
time, which is the difference between "delete this rule" and "these two
rules are one rule written twice".

Costs real money, more than the eval does — one full suite per rule.
