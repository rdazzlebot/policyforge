"""Which 800-53 controls a model is asked about, for one requirement.

A model cannot judge the 1,014 controls and enhancements in the catalog for
every requirement, so it judges a short list. The list decides what can be
proposed at all: a control not on it can never be suggested, however right.

Three sources, because each misses what the others find. Measured on the 75
HIPAA requirements against NIST's published mapping:

* **Word overlap** (BM25 over each control's title and statement) found 23%
  of the published pairs in its top 15. Crosswalks are written by people who
  know that "Security management process" is RA-1, and the words do not say
  so. It is still the only source that can find a pair nobody published.
* **The published pairs**, always included and never labelled as such. The
  model is asked to confirm or omit them with a quote like any other
  candidate; telling it which ones NIST chose would make agreement with NIST
  the easy answer and the measurement meaningless.
* **Each matched family's `-1` control** (AC-1, PS-1). HIPAA writes most
  standards as "implement policies and procedures to …", which is exactly
  what an 800-53 family's policy-and-procedures control requires, and word
  overlap rarely ranks it.
