"""Writes generated documents to output/ as plain markdown.

This is the primary export path (see README's "Output format priority") —
Confluence export (confluence_exporter.py) converts this same output rather
than generating separately. `check_markdown_quality` is the enforcement
mechanism: call it before treating generated output as final.

output/ is gitignored (see .gitignore) since generated policies contain
org-specific context that shouldn't land in this public repo.

#: `frontmatter` is not optional. Without it mdformat reads a leading `---`
#: as a thematic break and rewrites the YAML underneath it into headings and
#: list items: the stamp `content/provenance.py` writes would be reported as
#: badly formatted, and anything that then *applied* mdformat would destroy
#: it. The pre-commit config has carried that warning since frontmatter
#: first appeared in this repo; this function did not have the extension.
