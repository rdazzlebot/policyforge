"""`scripts/release.py`: the cut as gated steps (#255).

The engine is tested with synthetic steps and spies, so every claim in the
script's contract is shown to hold and to FAIL when it should: a dry run
never acts, a failed gate stops before acting, an outward step needs its
key typed, the wait for the user's merge stops and resumes. The real step
list is tested for its order and for what it must never do.
