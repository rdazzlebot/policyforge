"""Calls a Claude model hosted on Google Cloud's Vertex AI Model Garden, via
Anthropic's own Vertex client. That client exposes the same request/
response shape as the direct Anthropic API — see `_anthropic_compat.py`,
shared with AnthropicProvider, including the same `temperature`-deprecation
retry.

Auth deliberately isn't an `api_key_env` like AnthropicProvider: Vertex AI
uses Google Cloud's Application Default Credentials (`gcloud auth
application-default login`, a service account key file, or a GCE/GKE-
attached identity) via `google-auth`, so there's no single key to name in
config.yaml. Configure credentials the normal `gcloud`/ADC way; this
provider only needs a GCP project ID, region, and model ID.
