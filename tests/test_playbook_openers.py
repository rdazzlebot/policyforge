"""A Playbook sentence may open with one of four closed shapes before "NIST suggests" (#319).

`framed_as_nists` read the subject from the first word, so "Among the 7
actions NIST suggests for Govern 1.4, NIST suggests ..." -- a compliant
attribution -- was an ERROR in `policyforge check`. b5 found it in #301's
production run: glm-5.3-flash via OpenRouter wrote 17 such sentences, one per
subcategory, and the gate flagged 17 of 17.

80's corrected ruling: the opener is one of a CLOSED list of shapes, with the
subcategory id checked against the shipped catalog. The first ruling allowed
any prepositional phrase with no binding verb, and ba measured three
commitments passing inside it ("... the organization will adopt these, NIST
suggests ..."), because `classify` does not count will / commits / is
responsible as binding. So anything not in the list fails, by default.

**The stored sentences:** `fixtures/playbook_glm_among_sentences.md` holds
the 17 lines verbatim from b5's run301 output,
`glm-ai-governance-accountability.md` (topic "AI Governance & Accountability",
$0.0036). They are replayed here with no model call.
