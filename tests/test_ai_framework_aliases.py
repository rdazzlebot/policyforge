"""Keys for the two AI catalogs, pinned before either catalog exists.

**The cheap moment is now.** `NIST AI RMF` would take the bare `nist`
key — the orphan the NIST-family split existed to remove — and
`HITRUST AI Security Certification` collides outright with `HITRUST CSF`.
That second one is not hypothetical: HITRUST's AI certification is an
add-on to a CSF assessment and cannot be held standalone, so a user who
brings one almost certainly has both, and their requirement ids would
share a bucket.

Both names are already citable — capital-initial, so neither repeats the
digit-initial trap that made two CFR catalogs impossible to cite. What
was missing was the key.
