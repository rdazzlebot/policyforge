"""Refuse committed shell that reports success for a command that failed.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `cmd | tail` takes its exit status from `tail`, so the
status of `cmd` is discarded. Written as `cmd | tail && action`, it reads as
sequencing and is a concatenation: the action runs whatever `cmd` returned.
#213 catalogued **seven instances in one day**, every one caught downstream
and none prevented at the moment of typing, and three of those were in
sessions that had the rule in front of them.

**The rule was already written down** — in the team charge, in
`docs/verifying-a-merge.md`, in four sessions' memory files. Restating it
produced no measured reduction, because a rule that must be recalled fires
when you are already being careful and `| tail` is what you type when you
are not.

WHAT IT FOUND ON THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN. One line, and it was ours:

    .github/workflows/ci.yml:91
    run: git ls-files -z '*.md' | xargs -0 mdformat --check

Measured, in both directions, rather than argued:

    bash -e             'false | xargs -0 mdformat --check'  -> exit 0
    bash -e -o pipefail 'false | xargs -0 mdformat --check'  -> exit 1

So if `git ls-files` failed, **CI's markdown check passed having examined
nothing** — a green light the whole team had been reading as "markdown is
fine". GitHub's default shell is `bash -e` with no pipefail, and the only
`shell: bash` default in that file is on a different job.

THE SECOND PATH, WHICH PIPEFAIL DOES NOT CLOSE. Found by policyforge-9b
against the fix above, which is why it is here:

    mdformat --check      (no paths at all)  -> exit 0
      "No files have been passed in. Doing nothing."

`xargs` without `-r` runs the command once on empty input. If `git ls-files`
*succeeds* and matches nothing — a renamed directory, a pattern that stops
matching — the tool runs, checks zero files and exits 0. Nothing failed, so
pipefail never fires. **A check whose population can silently become empty
reports the absence of input as the absence of problems**, which is the same
defect `test_the_population_is_not_empty` guards in #214, one layer out.

Hence two rules, not one, and `EMPTY_INPUT_TOOLS` below is the second.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, deliberately.

It does not lint the interactive shell BY ITSELF. Three of #213's first seven
instances, and the eighth, were typed at a prompt. Since #213, `--command`
checks one typed command and `--hook` does the same for a Claude Code
PreToolUse payload, so a hook can refuse a command before it runs.
**Whether that hook is installed is the user's choice, in their own
settings. This file does not install it,** so until someone does, the
typed surface is exactly as unguarded as before.

It does not see a status query before `&&` (`gh pr view ... && gh pr merge`:
a question that exits 0 whatever the answer). A list of such commands would
be the class-versus-instance trap. Nor does it see a command that exits 0
having done nothing (an inert mutation, a no-op revert). No shell rule can,
and checking the postcondition is the only defence. Both are stated limits
(#213), pinned where a test can pin them.

It does not require `set -o pipefail` in documentation snippets. A snippet is
something a reader runs by hand and watches; a script is something that runs
unattended and is believed. Only the second kind gets the requirement.

It does not forbid pipes. `PIPEFAIL_EXEMPT` takes a site and a reason for a
pipeline whose status genuinely does not matter, **pinned by the text of the
line rather than by a line number**, so an exemption cannot silently widen to
cover a line that moved underneath it.

Usage:

    python scripts/shell_status.py            # check; non-zero on a finding
    python scripts/shell_status.py --list     # print the population it derived
    python scripts/shell_status.py --command 'CMD'   # one command; 1 on a finding
    python scripts/shell_status.py --hook     # PreToolUse JSON on stdin; 2 blocks

#: someone adds a linter to CI. Measured in this venv rather than argued:

    disagree about it. A YAML load sees flow and block style identically, so
    that step is counted here and missed by the parser, and the disagreement
    is the alarm.

    **Only `jobs.<id>.steps[*].run` holding a string**, which is where GitHub
    executes a shell. Two lookalikes are deliberately not counted, and both
    are measured on this tree:

    - `defaults: run: shell: bash` is a mapping, not a script. The line
      parser takes it as a block whose body is `shell: bash`, so on `ci.yml`
      the parser yields 15 and this yields 14. The floor only fires when the
      parser has FEWER, so this over-count on the parser side is harmless.
    - A step input named `run` under `with:` belongs to the action, not
      to a shell.

    **The census agrees on COUNT, not on CONTENT** (policyforge-9b, on #326).
    With an anchor, `run: &cmd "x | tail && y"` in one step and `run: *cmd`
    in another, this counts both, and so does the parser, 2 = 2. But the
    parser lints the literal text `*cmd`, not the resolved command, so the
    aliased step's swallowed status is not reported.
    `test_an_aliased_run_agrees_on_count_and_is_not_linted` pins that. The
    tree has 0 anchors today (5 workflows). Closing it means handing the
    parser the YAML-resolved strings, which gives up the line numbers the
    parser exists to keep.

    A workflow that does not parse raises `yaml.YAMLError`. `main` reports
    that as exit 2, because the census cannot vouch for a file it cannot

    **This is the second derivation, and it exists because of a real hole.**
    `main` originally refused only an entirely empty population, so breaking
    a single pathspec left the other kinds intact and the tool printed
    `clean` — while `ci.yml`, this lint's one real finding, went unexamined
    and exit was 0. Found by policyforge-9b by mutating one pathspec.

    **`0 script` is today's correct state**, since the repository has no
    committed `*.sh` files, so a bare "no kind may be zero" rule would be
    wrong on arrival. Hence a census: a kind may be zero only when nothing
    of that kind looks like it should have produced anything.

    **What this defends against is an EDITED PATHSPEC, not a renamed
    directory** — policyforge-9b's correction, and the distinction is not
    pedantic. GitHub reads workflows only from `.github/workflows/`, so
    renaming that directory means those files stop being workflows and
    reporting zero is *right* rather than blind. The plausible event is
    someone editing `population()` and not `_SIGNALS`, which is exactly
    what was measured.

    **The residual, so it is a known floor rather than a surprise.** The
    two derivations are independent in *method* but share a *pathspec
    prefix*, and they sit about forty lines apart. Point both at
    `.github/ci/*` and this reports `clean across 26 source(s)` and exits
    0, with five workflow files still tracked and unexamined — measured,
    not supposed. That takes two coordinated edits rather than one, so it
    is narrower than what the census catches, but it is not zero.
    **A second derivation raises the cost of going blind; it does not make
    it impossible.** #256 closed the other shared-blindness, a shared
    *pattern shape*, by moving the counters onto a different mechanism. It
    did not touch the shared pathspec.

    # a tree that still contained the violation.
    #
    # `0 script` is today's CORRECT state (no committed *.sh), so the rule
    # cannot be "no kind may be zero". The census is an independent, cruder
    # derivation of "should this kind have produced anything", which is what
    # separates *nothing to find* from *stopped looking*. See `census()` for
    # what this does and does not defend against -- notably that a renamed
    # `.github/workflows/` is a legitimate zero, and that two coordinated
    # edits still defeat both derivations.
    # **Compared as SETS OF FILES, not as counts per kind.** The first
    # version compared `census()` against the parser per kind and fired
    # only when the parser produced zero of a kind, so a 56% loss of the
    # workflow population reported `clean` and exited 0 -- measured on the
    # train. The cause was not the comparison but the UNITS: the census
    # counted files (3 workflows) and the parser counted run-blocks (34),
    # and the only question answerable across those two numbers is whether
    # both are zero. Extent was unreachable by construction, not by
    # oversight. See #228.
    #
    # Naming the files rather than counting them puts both sides in the
    # same unit, and it needs no pinned bound: the population may grow
    # freely, and a file that stops being examined is named rather than
    # absorbed into a smaller total.
    #
    # **What this does NOT close, measured rather than reasoned about.**
    # policyforge-b5's formulation of #228 is that a shrink is invisible
    # *because* a check was made more specific -- so the same question
    # has to be asked of this fix. Asked and answered:
    #
    #     edit the parser pathspec only     before: exit 0, silent
    #                                        after: exit 2, names both files
    #     edit census AND parser pathspecs  before: exit 0
    #                                        after: exit 0      <- unchanged
    #
    # The one-edit case is closed; the coordinated two-edit case is not,
    # and is the residual `census()` already discloses. It is unchanged
    # by this, not introduced by it. Both derivations reach the tree
    # through a pathspec, so narrowing both in step defeats them both --
    # which is an argument for deriving from the whole tracked set and
    # classifying, so a narrowed spec moves files to "unclassified"
    # rather than out of existence. Not done here: one edit is the
    # accident-shaped case, two coordinated edits in the same direction
    # forty lines apart is not.
    # **Compared in BLOCKS, per file.** The previous version compared FILE
    # SETS -- census files minus produced files. That catches a file falling
    # out of the derivation entirely and is blind to a file producing FEWER
    # BLOCKS than it holds: capping run-blocks at one per file took the
    # population 34 -> 3, a 91% loss, every file still produced something,
    # so the set difference was empty and this exited 0 saying `clean`. A
    # real violation inside a dropped block was invisible, not merely
    # uncounted.
    #
    # Found by policyforge-9b; confirmed by policyforge-ba, who seeded a
    # real `| tail -4 && git push` inside a dropped block and watched it go
    # from exit 1 to exit 0.
    #
    # **The unit is the whole fix, and ba named the trap that was waiting
