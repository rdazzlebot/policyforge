"""An invented shorthand id cannot downgrade the Playbook gate (#340).

1d, reviewing #337: under #333's rule an inherited part counted as the
Playbook only if it resolved, so `[NIST AI RMF Playbook Govern 1.1 Action 1 |
Govern 9.9 Action 1]` -- an action NIST never published -- made the sentence
mixed, the gate never read it, and "Acme will adopt ..." fell from an ERROR
to a strength warning. No finding named `Govern 9.9`.

80's ruling, (b) with (a) as its reporting half:
- (b) inheritance is decided by known framework names -- ONE list, derived
  from every catalog on disk and shared with `satisfies` -- and an inherited
  Playbook part keeps the sentence Playbook-only whether or not it resolves;
- (a) `check` reports the unresolvable inherited part as its own ERROR.
