"""Calls a model behind an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`
endpoint — a local runtime (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp's server, vLLM)
or a hosted one (Vertex AI's Model-as-a-Service open models, and most
third-party inference vendors). They all speak the same request/response
shape, so one provider covers the lot; only `base_url` changes.

Deliberately built on `requests`, which this project already depends on,
rather than the `openai` SDK. The surface used here is one POST and three
fields of the reply, and an extra dependency (plus an extra install extra
to document) buys nothing for that.

Auth is optional, unlike every other provider here: a local server on
localhost normally has none, so `api_key_env` is only consulted if
config.yaml names it. That is the one place this differs from
AnthropicProvider, where a missing key is always an error.

Running locally is not only about token cost. This project keeps licensed
BYOC exports (HITRUST, GovRAMP) out of git precisely because redistributing
them is a licence question, and sending one to a third-party API processor
is the same question wearing a different hat — see the README's licensing
section and `generate-parser`'s warning. A model on localhost removes that
question rather than answering it.
