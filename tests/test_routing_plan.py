"""A question that asks for two analyses gets both, and no question gets a spurious one.

The risk this is built around is not a missed second report — that is a
follow-up question. It is an unwanted one: an extra report attached to an
ordinary question, burying the answer somebody asked for. So most of these
pin the conservative edges, and the routing decision itself is checked to be
exactly what it was.
