"""Shared internals for the two providers that talk to arbitrary models —
OpenAICompatProvider and LiteLLMProvider. Both face the same problem, which
`_anthropic_compat.py` solves for the Anthropic SDK: a reasoning model
spends tokens thinking before it writes an answer, and neither the thinking
nor a budget exhausted by it is an answer.

Where the model puts its reasoning varies by transport, which is exactly
why this is shared rather than assumed:

- A raw OpenAI-compatible server (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp) inlines it
  in `content` as a <think> block, so it has to be cut out.
- LiteLLM normalises it into a separate `reasoning_content` field, so
  `content` arrives clean — but arrives *empty* when the budget ran out
  mid-thought, which is the same failure wearing different clothes.

Handling both means neither provider has to care which transport it got.
