"""Closing the gap between how a question is asked and how a document is written.

Retrieval matches the words people use, and that holds for most of a
compliance corpus because the vocabulary is terms of art the askers learned
from the documents. It fails on the paraphrase: *how often do we check who
has admin?* against a Standard that only ever says **privileged access
review cadence**. Not one content word overlaps, and the honest refusal that
earns is wrong — the document answers the question completely.

**Exact first, expansion only on a miss.** Nothing here runs while retrieval
is finding passages on the user's own words, which keeps the common case
free and, more importantly, keeps it precise: an expansion is a guess at
vocabulary, and a guess mixed into a search that was already working can
only make it worse. Expansion is what happens instead of a refusal, not
alongside a success.

**Why not embeddings.** The README's earlier note said this gap wanted a
vector index alongside the exact matching, and that would work. It would
also need an embedding model — a local one means a multi-gigabyte dependency
for a tool that currently installs in seconds, and a hosted one means an API
this project's own default provider does not offer, since Anthropic ships no
embeddings endpoint. Neither is a good trade for a corpus of tens to
hundreds of documents. Asking the model that is already configured to name
the vocabulary a document would use gets the same recall on this failure
mode, adds no dependency, and has the property embeddings do not: you can
read the expansion and see exactly why a passage surfaced.

What that leaves uncovered is scale. Expansion is one guess per question;
embeddings would rank the whole corpus by meaning. If a document set ever
grows past the point where a handful of extra terms can bridge it, the seam
is `RetrievalIndex.search(..., expansion=...)` — a scorer that already
weighs guessed vocabulary below the user's own words and keeps them
separable in the result.

Rules:

1. Terms only, separated by commas. No sentences, no explanation, no
   numbering, no restating the question.
2. Formal register. A question says "who has admin"; a Standard says
   "privileged access", "administrative accounts", "elevated entitlements".
   Give the Standard's words.
3. Never invent specifics. No control identifiers, no numbers, no
   frequencies, no team or vendor names. You are naming vocabulary, not
   answering — and a frequency you supplied would be searched for and might
   well be found, which would attach this tool's guess to a real citation.
4. At most twelve terms. If the question is already in the documents' own
   register, return fewer, or nothing at all."""
