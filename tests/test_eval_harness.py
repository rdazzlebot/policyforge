"""The eval harness's own grading, tested without an API key.

A harness whose scoring is wrong is worse than no harness: it produces
numbers that look like evidence. So the grading logic is graded here, with
scripted providers, and only the *running* of it needs a model.

The property that matters most is that flaky is not passing. A case right
seven times in eight is indistinguishable from a case right always if you
only look once, and looking only once is the mistake that shipped a routing
bug.
