"""Calls any model LiteLLM can reach, which is most of them: Anthropic,
OpenAI, Gemini, Bedrock, Vertex, Azure, Groq, Together, a local Ollama, and
a long tail besides. One config string picks the provider *and* the model —
`anthropic/claude-opus-5`, `ollama_chat/qwen3:14b`, `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash` —
so comparing two models across two vendors is a one-line edit rather than a
second provider class.

This exists alongside OpenAICompatProvider rather than replacing it,
because they answer different questions. OpenAICompatProvider needs no
dependency beyond `requests` and talks to anything exposing
`/v1/chat/completions` — including a LiteLLM *proxy*, which means the proxy
route already worked before this file existed. This provider is the SDK
route: no gateway process to run, and per-call cost comes back from
LiteLLM's own pricing tables, which is what makes a quality comparison
across models also a cost comparison.

Auth is deliberately not an `api_key_env` by default. LiteLLM resolves
credentials per provider from its own conventions (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
GEMINI_API_KEY, AWS's chain, GCP ADC), so naming one variable here would be
wrong for every model string but one. `api_key_env` stays available for the
endpoints that need an explicit key, such as a proxy.
