"""The HITRUST AI BYOC directory, and the claims its README makes.

**A README-only catalog is the whole deliverable**, so the README is the
thing to test. It makes three claims that can go stale without anyone
noticing: that the directory ships no manifest, that the two spellings key
away from the CSF, and that `etl-hitrust` must not be pointed at an AI
export.

The last is a claim about another command's behaviour, which is the class
that has been wrong twice on this project — a README saying what a command
does, with nothing checking it.
