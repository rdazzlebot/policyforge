"""One interface between the content tree and a live page store.

`publish`, `wiki-drift` and `pull` were written against Confluence, and the
decisions they make — fetch the live page, refuse one this tool cannot
round-trip, refuse one somebody edited since the last publish, write, say
what would reconcile — were written in Confluence's terms: a space key, a
storage-format body, a version number, a version message. None of those
decisions is about Confluence. A GitHub wiki holds the same facts as a
git repository of markdown files: a commit sha where Confluence has a
version number, a commit trailer where it has a version message, the file
itself where it has storage format.

So the decisions live here, once, over a `LivePage`, and everything that
knows how a particular store spells them is a `Publisher`. The Confluence
adapter below wraps `confluence_importer`, `confluence_exporter` and
`confluence_search` unchanged; the loops in `publish.py`, `drift.py` and
`pull.py` are the generic ones and produce, for Confluence, exactly the
reports and the exporter calls they produced before this module existed
(`tests/test_publisher_equivalence.py` holds that, argument for argument).

A document names its destinations in frontmatter under `targets:`, keyed
by kind. `confluence:` at the top level, the spelling every existing tree
uses, is an alias for `targets.confluence` and keeps working as it is:

    targets:
      confluence: {space: SEC, title: Access Review Standard, version: 12}

The three guards, stated once so an adapter cannot half-implement them:

* **Unsupported content.** A live page holding something the round trip
  would flatten — Confluence macros; on a wiki, a page in a format other
  than markdown — is skipped by name rather than published over.
* **Moved.** A live page is overwritten only when its latest version was
  written by this tool, or is the version `pull` recorded in the document,
  or already says what the document says. Anything else has moved, and a
  moved page is reported and fails the run.
* **Dry run.** Every loop plans unless told to apply, and a plan reads
  pages and writes nothing.

    One thing is deliberately *not* generic: what "the page already says
    this" means. `LivePage.body` is the store's native body and
    `same_content` belongs to the adapter, rather than the page carrying a
    `body_markdown` the loop could compare itself, because Confluence
    compares in storage format — a page it reflowed on save is unchanged,
    and a page published before the stamp existed is adopted on that
    comparison — while a git-backed wiki compares bytes, where any
    difference is an edit. Converting a Confluence body to markdown before
    comparing would quietly change which edits count as "the wiki changed
    this", and a guard loosened by tidying is worse than one that looks
