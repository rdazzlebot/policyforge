"""Every catalog says whether a topic may anchor it (#175, with #183).

Adding a catalog was forced to declare its licence, its bundled-or-BYOC
status, its alias key and its README row -- and never whether a topic may
anchor it, the one declaration that decides whether its requirements enter
`/coverage` and synthesis. Both wrong directions shipped silently: #171 (the
AI topics anchored, `/coverage` said 82% owned, synthesis retrieved zero)
and #169 (a catalog counted in scope that nobody adopted).

The populations below are DERIVED -- from the directories under
`data/frameworks/` and from the scaffold lists -- so a new catalog joins them
without anyone remembering to list it.
