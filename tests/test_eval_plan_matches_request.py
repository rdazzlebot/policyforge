"""The plan runs what was asked for, and says where it differs (#275, #276).

Two ways the harness planned a population the command line did not state:

- **#275.** A `--cases` file gained the 66 shipped paraphrase cases whatever
  it said, and the shipped rewordings of any answering case whose name
  matched a shipped parent. A file of two routing cases planned 68, and a
  file's own `paraphrase:` rows were replaced by the shipped set. 80's
  ruling: **the file you name is the whole population.**
- **#276.** `--suite routing --suite routing` planned the 18 routing cases
  twice, doubling the spend and counting each case twice in the epoch.

Both are fixed by planning exactly what was asked and **printing a line
wherever the plan differs from the command line**, because a silent
correction is one more population change nobody can see. Every notice here
has a quiet twin: a notice that also fires on an ordinary run is one people
learn to read past. And the real run is tested as well as the dry run,
because the dry run returns before the report that becomes an epoch (9b's
finding on #274).

Every measurement here is a dry run or a stubbed run, so it costs $0.
