"""ARC-AMPE, and which of its two volumes actually holds the controls.

ARC-AMPE — Acceptable Risk Controls for ACA, Medicaid, and Partner Entities
— is CMS's security and privacy framework for Health Insurance Exchanges and
the entities around them. It supersedes and replaces MARS-E and the
Non-Exchange Entity GRC Framework, effective on publication. Published by
CMS, a federal agency, with no copyright notice or redistribution
restriction: a US government work, so it may be bundled here on the same
basis as NIST 800-53 and the HIPAA Security Rule.

## Volume I is not the catalog

Worth stating because the obvious source is the wrong one. ARC-AMPE ships in
two volumes and the one that turns up first in a search — `ARC-AMPE Volume
I`, a 55-page PDF — is the narrative: scope, applicability, roles, the
relationship to the ACA AE CSF Profile. It contains no controls. Volume I
says so itself, in a footnote it repeats four times: "ARC-AMPE Volume II is
the System Security and Privacy Plan (SSPP) template with required baseline
controls."

Volume II is an `.xlsx`, and it is what this module reads. A loader pointed
at Volume I would parse cleanly and find nothing, which is the failure mode
worth naming in a docstring rather than leaving for somebody to rediscover.

## What the workbook is

Volume II is an SSPP *template*, not a data export — most of its eight
sheets are blank grids for an entity to fill in. One sheet, `AE Mandatory
Baseline`, carries the catalog: 402 controls for an ACA Administering
Entity, each with CMS's own control statement, supplemental requirements and
guidance, and related controls. The remaining columns of that sheet — six
pairs of "Control Implementation Description" and "Control Status" — are the
blanks, and are deliberately not ingested. A schema field nothing reads is
clutter that reads as data.

Unlike the FedRAMP tailoring, this is a **real mandatory baseline**: every
row is required of an ACA AE, which is why `Control.baseline` is set here
and left unset there.

Two details of the text are load-bearing:

* **The control statements are already tailored.** Where 800-53 writes
  `[Assignment: organization-defined time period]`, ARC-AMPE writes "within
  twenty-four (24) hours" and "five (5) consecutive invalid logon attempts".
  CMS has made these decisions and the numbers are in the prose, not in a
  parameter table — so unlike a profile there is nothing to put in
  `parameter_values`, and folding the statements into anything else would
  lose the decided values.
* **95 of the 402 guidance cells are a placeholder**, reading "There are no
  supplemental control requirements and guidance for this control". That is
  the template saying nothing, not CMS saying something, so it is dropped to
  an empty `discussion` rather than carried into a generated document as if
  it were guidance.

## The DEE baseline is not public

CMS publishes a second Volume II for Direct Enrollment Entities, a smaller
308-control baseline. It is distributed through CMS zONE, which requires
requested access, so it is not fetched here and not bundled. `--export`
takes a local path for anyone who has it.

## Identifiers

The workbook writes `AC-01` and `AC-02(01)`, zero-padded. This codebase and
OSCAL write `AC-1` and `AC-2(1)`, and the identifier is the join key that
lets `policyforge map` crosswalk ARC-AMPE onto 800-53 — all 402 resolve
against the bundled Rev 5 catalog — so ids are normalized on the way in.
