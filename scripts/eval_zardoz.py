"""Run the graded eval cases against your configured model.

    python scripts/eval_zardoz.py --repeat 5
    python scripts/eval_zardoz.py --suite routing --repeat 20
    python scripts/eval_zardoz.py --dry-run

Comparing models is the other reason to run this. `--model` takes a LiteLLM
model string and overrides config.yaml's `llm` block with it, so a sweep is a
shell loop rather than a config file per candidate. It is an override, not a
second constructor: the provider is built the way every command builds one,
through `get_provider`, ledger wrapper and all — see `evals/provider.py` for
why that has to be true of a harness whose numbers describe production:

    for m in anthropic/claude-sonnet-5 ollama_chat/qwen3:14b; do
        python scripts/eval_zardoz.py --model "$m" --suite routing --repeat 3
    done

The report then carries what the run cost as well as what it scored, because
a pass rate without a price does not decide anything. A local model reports
0.0 and a provider that cannot say reports nothing at all — those are
different answers and the report keeps them apart.

Costs real money and needs network, which is why it is not part of
`scripts/check.py`. The prompts are the only part of this project that
cannot be tested against fixtures — whether the answerer refuses, whether
the router picks correctly, whether the rewriter invents a detail are all
properties of a model's behaviour.

`--repeat` is the point. A routing bug measured at one failure in eight came
back clean on its first two probes; graded once per case it would have
shipped. The report is a rate, and a case that passes seven times in eight
is reported as flaky rather than as passing.
