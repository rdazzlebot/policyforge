"""45 CFR Part 171 — information blocking — from eCFR's published XML.

**This part is not a control catalog in the sense 800-53 is**, and a reader
who takes it for one will misread every report it appears in. 800-53 says
what to implement. Part 171 defines a *practice* — information blocking —
and then sets out the exceptions: the conditions under which a practice
that would otherwise be blocking is not. So a control here is a condition
of an exception, and citing `171.203(a)` says a practice qualifies for the
security exception, not that a safeguard exists. The catalog's README says
this in the terms a buyer reads; it is repeated here because the next
person to change this parser will read the module before the README.

**The shape, and why.** A section is a control and its top-level lettered
paragraphs are its conditions, carried as enhancements; deeper nesting
stays in the condition's text. That is the same split `hipaa_loader` makes
between a Standard and its implementation specifications, so a reader who
knows one catalog can read the other. It is also what the regulation
contains: `171.203` is "Security exception" and (a)-(e) are the conditions
a practice must meet, while (d)(1)-(4) qualify condition (d) — the
contents of a written security policy — rather than standing as separate
duties.

**What is deliberately dropped.** `[Reserved]` sections — `171.402` today,
and Subparts E-I wholesale — carry a number and a title and no
obligations. A parse that emitted them would produce controls that are
countable, plausible and empty, which is the failure this project keeps
finding rather than a hypothetical one: every check except "is this
control real" passes on them. Definitions sections are dropped for the
reason `hipaa_loader` drops them, that a defined term is not a requirement.

Fetching is `ingest/ecfr.py`, shared with every regulation this project
reads. The wrappers below name 45 CFR 171's own coordinates, because
"which title and part is information blocking" is a property of the
regulation rather than a choice an ETL command should make.

import re

# Parsed with the stdlib parser rather than regex over the raw markup, which
# is what `hipaa_loader` does for the neighbouring regulation. The difference
# is `<I>`: Part 171 names most of its conditions in an italic run inside the
# paragraph, and those names are content this catalog keeps. Matching `<P>`
# bodies textually would have to reproduce the element's own nesting rules to
# get them out.
#
# Both bandit (B405/B314) and semgrep (use-defused-xml) want `defusedxml`
# here. Their shared headline — XXE leaking confidential data — was measured
# against this parser rather than argued about, on CPython 3.12:
#
#   XXE local file read   REFUSED  ParseError: undefined entity &x;
#   external DTD fetch    ignored, nothing requested
#   billion laughs        EXPANDED 10,000 chars from four levels
#
# So the disclosure risk the rules describe does not reach this code: the
# stdlib parser refuses undefined entities outright and fetches no external
# DTD. The third line is the real one, and it is why this comment exists
# rather than a flat "false positive" — internal entity expansion works, and
# the classic nine-level payload reaches gigabytes.
#
# That bound is accepted deliberately. The input is one document fetched over
# HTTPS from ecfr.gov by an `etl-*` command the operator runs, and the worst a
# hostile response achieves is exhausting memory on the machine of the person
# who invoked it — a crash, not code execution and not data disclosure.
# `defusedxml` would convert that crash into a clean error, and costs a
# runtime dependency for every install plus a change to the Homebrew formula.
#
# **The premise this rests on: the host is fixed.** `ecfr._API` is the
# constant `https://www.ecfr.gov/api/versioner/v1`, with no override — so the
# XML cannot come from anywhere an attacker chooses. If the fetch ever accepts
# an operator-supplied URL, or this parser is pointed at third-party or
# user-supplied XML, every line above stops being true and `defusedxml`
# becomes the right answer. Stated because a change that parameterises the
# URL would invalidate this reasoning silently, without ever meeting it.
#
# ElementTree rather than regex over the markup — which is what `hipaa_loader`
# does for the neighbouring regulation — because of `<I>`: Part 171 names most
# of its conditions in an italic run inside the paragraph, and those names are
# content this catalog keeps. Matching `<P>` bodies textually would have to
# reproduce the element's own nesting rules to get them out.

TITLE = 45
PART = "171"

#: **The declared name must be citable, which means it must not begin with
#: a digit.** `content/tags.SOURCE_TAG_RE` builds a framework name from
#: capital-initial words, so `[45 CFR 171 171.203(a)]` is not a tag at all -- it is
#: prose, and a document citing this catalog reported nothing cited while
#: `satisfies --strict` exited 0. `FRAMEWORK_ALIASES` cannot rescue it: the
#: pattern rejects the string before any normalisation runs, so the alias
#: table is downstream of the failure. The alias below pins the key; this
#: name is what makes the citation reachable at all.
FRAMEWORK = "Information Blocking"

#: A section identifier as this part writes them. Four digits are real and
#: load-bearing: Subpart J (disincentives) is 171.1000-171.1002 and Subpart
#: K (transparency) is 171.1100-171.1101. A pattern fitted to the first few
#: sections would drop five of twenty-four without saying so.
SECTION_ID_RE = re.compile(r"^171\.\d{3,4}$")

#: A condition identifier: a section, then one lettered paragraph.
CONDITION_ID_RE = re.compile(r"^171\.\d{3,4}\([a-z]\)$")

#: `(a)` opening a paragraph — the lettered conditions that are the
#: assessable units. Digits and roman numerals are deeper nesting and stay
#: inside the condition they qualify.
_LETTERED_RE = re.compile(r"^\(([a-z])\)\s*(.*)$", re.DOTALL)

#: `(1)` opening a paragraph — one level below a lettered condition.
_DIGIT_RE = re.compile(r"^\(\d+\)")

#: Single letters that are also roman numerals. `(i)` is both the ninth
#: letter and roman one, and eCFR's XML gives no structural hint: `(a)`,
#: `(1)` and `(i)` are flat sibling `<P>` elements at every depth. Today
#: every `(i)` in this part is roman — `171.303` has conditions (a), (b),
#: (c), and the five `(i)`s under its digits are numerals — so a regex
#: matching any single letter read that section as nine conditions, five
#: of them sharing the id `171.303(i)`. Excluding these letters outright
#: would be wrong the day a section reaches a ninth condition, hence the
#: successor rule in `_opens_condition`.
#:
#: Only `i`, `v` and `x` belong here. The wider roman alphabet does not:
#: `c`, `d`, `l` and `m` are 100 and up, which no paragraph list reaches,
#: while they are ordinary condition letters — including them cost
#: `171.201` its conditions (d), (e) and (f), because `(d)` arriving after
#: a digit was read as a numeral.
