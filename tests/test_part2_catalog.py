"""The shipped 42 CFR Part 2 catalog, and the README that explains it.

Provenance — that `content_sha256` still matches `controls.json` — is
covered generically for every bundled catalog by `test_provenance.py`.
What is not covered generically is the thing this catalog is unusual for:
**its README makes numeric claims about the data beside it**, and it makes
them because the count is the first thing a reader will doubt. A README
that drifts from its own catalog is worse than one that says nothing,
because it is the document that exists to stop someone re-running the
parser.
