"""Grading Zardoz's prompts against a real model, repeatably.

Everything else in this repository is tested against fixtures, which is
right: fixtures are fast, free, and answer the same way every time. But four
things here are prompts, and a prompt cannot be tested that way. Whether the
answerer refuses when the passages do not support a claim, whether the
router picks the right analysis, whether the rewriter invents a detail — all
of that is a property of a model's behaviour, and the only way to know it is
to ask the model.

**One run is not evidence.** That is the lesson this harness is built
around. A truncation bug in the routing budget was measured at one failure
in eight, and the first two probes came back clean; had it been graded once
per case it would have shipped. So every case runs `--repeat` times and the
report is a *rate*, not a verdict. A case that passes seven times out of
eight is not a passing case, and a harness that cannot tell the difference
is worse than none.

**Grading is deterministic.** No model judges another model's output. Every
check is a substring, a citation marker, a refusal sentinel, or the
project's own `check_answer` — the same integrity checks that run in
production. A grader that itself needed a model would have the failure mode
it exists to detect.

Kept out of the test suite deliberately: these cost money and need network,
and a suite people cannot run offline is a suite people stop running.
