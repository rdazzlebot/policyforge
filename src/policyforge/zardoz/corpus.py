"""A local snapshot of the documents Zardoz answers from.

Documents reach the corpus from two places, and the difference is about
authority rather than convenience:

* **markdown** — files in the content tree. In a repo-backed setup these are
  the source of truth: they are what review happens on, what git history
  records, and what gets published. Reading them needs no network and no
  credentials at all, which means the whole answering path can be developed,
  tested and demonstrated without an Atlassian account.
* **confluence** — pages fetched from the wiki. In a repo-backed setup this
  is the *published output*, useful for finding what has drifted from the
  tree; where the wiki is still the system of record it is the only source
  there is. Either way it costs a round trip per page.

Why a snapshot rather than reading live on every question: a Confluence round
trip is 300-800ms, answering one question well wants several, the API is
rate-limited per token, and a conversation is a burst rather than a trickle.
A local corpus also means retrieval can be developed against fixtures that
answer identically every time, which is what keeps ranking work honest.

Orthogonally to where a document came from, the corpus carries two
confidence levels, and the distinction is load-bearing:

* **trusted** — the document knows who is accountable for it, because the
  topic registry declares it or its frontmatter says so. An answer drawn
  from it can name an owner and say whether a threshold belongs there.
* **supporting** — real content that nobody has claimed: a page from the
  configured extra space, or a file in the tree with no topic and no owner.
  Answers may draw on it and must say they did.

Sync is deliberately forgiving of individual failures and unforgiving of
silent ones. A registry page whose title no longer matches is recorded as a
skip with its reason and the run continues, because one renamed page should
not cost you the other nineteen topics. But a sync that resolved *nothing*
will not overwrite a corpus that has documents in it: losing a working
snapshot to a typo'd space key is a failure you would discover by getting
worse answers, which is the worst way to discover anything.
