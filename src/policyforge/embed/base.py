"""Embedding vectors, for retrieval that is not looking for the same words.

`zardoz/retrieve.py` scores a passage on the words it shares with the
question, and gates hard on specificity so that "nothing in the synced
documents appears to bear on that" stays an honest answer. That design is
right and is why the shell refuses cleanly instead of returning noise. It
has one blind spot, and it is the one this module exists for: a passage
whose words differ from the question's never enters the candidate set at
all.

That is a **recall** failure, and it is what `the-users-own-words-survive`
measures — a rewrite turned "wipe" and "laptop" into "wiping of devices",
BM25 went looking for words the document does not contain, and the right
passage was never retrieved. Nothing downstream can fix that. A reranker
reorders what survived retrieval and cannot rescue what did not, which is
why this comes first and `rerank/` comes second.

`zardoz/paraphrase.py` is the existing workaround: ask a model to guess the
document's vocabulary, then search for the guesses. It works, it is honest
about being a guess, and it costs a model call per miss. Embeddings close
the same gap at the source.

Deliberately optional, like reranking. No `embed:` block means the lexical
retriever this project already had, unchanged.
