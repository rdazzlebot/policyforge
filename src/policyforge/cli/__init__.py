"""PolicyForge's command line, one command group per module.

This was a single 3,600-line `cli.py` holding thirty-four commands, each
carrying its own copy of config loading, catalog loading and the licensed-
write guard. It is now a package split by what the commands are for:

    etl        fetching framework catalogs
    llm        the model connection, the content boundary, the call ledger
    programme  ownership, coverage, parameters, drift — no model involved
    documents  drafting with a model
    content    the content tree and Confluence
    zardoz     the shell, discovery, corpus sync, the MCP server
    project    `init`, laying out a project for an installed package

The split was a pure move. Every definition was copied byte for byte, and the
command surface — every command, option, default and help string — was pinned
in tests/fixtures/cli_surface.json before a line moved and compared after.

Two names stay here because code outside the package depends on them being
here. `cli` is the entry point pyproject.toml installs. `load_config` and
`get_provider` are the seam every command reaches through `_common`, so a test
that patches them on this module reaches every command.
