"""A catalog's declared crosswalk relationship (#408, 80's ruling (y)).

NIST publishes CSF 2.0's mapping to 800-53 (OLIR 186) with no relationship
per pair and marks it `comprehensive: No`. So the CSF catalog declares
`crosswalk_relationship: source-untyped` in its manifest, and coverage reads
every CSF pair as partial: a CSF subcategory is never "covered" on the
strength of NIST's untyped link alone.

Three properties, each tested both with and without an overlay:

- a declaring catalog's pairs read `source-untyped`, so coverage is partial;
- seeding that catalog writes the declared relationship, so seeding changes
  nothing (the contract `seed_overlay` states);
- a catalog that declares nothing reads exactly as before.
