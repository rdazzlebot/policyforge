"""Run the full quality-check suite locally, in one command.

Runs the same checks enforced in .pre-commit-config.yaml and
.github/workflows/ci.yml: ruff (lint + format), pytest, bandit (static
security analysis), semgrep (broader SAST — catches patterns bandit's
Python-specific ruleset doesn't, e.g. GitHub Actions supply-chain hygiene),
pip-audit (dependency CVEs), mdformat (markdown quality), and gitleaks
(secrets scan, if installed).

Ruff's rule selection, line length and per-file ignores live in
pyproject.toml, so this script, the pre-commit hook and CI all enforce
exactly the same thing instead of drifting apart.

Each check is invoked directly rather than through
`pre-commit run` so this has no dependency on pre-commit's hook-environment
builds — notably, pre-commit's official gitleaks hook builds gitleaks from
source via Go on first run, which requires outbound access to Go's module
proxy (proxy.golang.org) and can fail on restrictive corporate networks
even though nothing is actually wrong with your setup. GitHub Actions CI
doesn't have this issue (see ci.yml, which uses the gitleaks-action
directly) — this script's gitleaks check is a local convenience, not the
only place it runs.

Usage:
    python scripts/check.py

Requires: pip install -e ".[dev]"

semgrep is not in the dev extra: it pins its own dependencies exactly, and
installed beside the project those pins became the project's. It is found on
PATH or in `.tools/semgrep`, built from its own hashed lock:

    python -m venv .tools/semgrep
    .tools/semgrep/Scripts/pip install --require-hashes -r requirements/semgrep/semgrep.txt

(`bin/` rather than `Scripts/` outside Windows). Without it, that check is
skipped with a note, as gitleaks is.

Optional: install the gitleaks binary to get the secrets scan locally too
(Windows: `winget install gitleaks.gitleaks`; otherwise download from
https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases). Without it, that one check
is skipped with a note, not silently ignored.
