"""Does the cited passage actually support the claim?

`zardoz/answer.py` verifies everything about an answer that can be decided
by looking: the citation points at a passage that exists, the quotation is
verbatim, no interval appears that no passage states, no placeholder is
presented as a value, no unowned source goes undisclosed. All of it is a
pattern or a comparison, and all of it is exact.

None of it can answer the remaining question. Given a passage that says
*"IT Asset Management shall generate and retain Certificates of
Destruction"*, the sentence *"The Security Officer approves Certificates of
Destruction. [1]"* cites correctly, quotes nothing, invents no interval and
names no placeholder — and is wrong about both the actor and the act. Every
deterministic check passes it. That is the gap, and it is the failure mode
an assessor would notice first.

**This is a model judging a model, and that is a real cost.**
`evals/runner.py` refuses it for grading, with a reason that holds: *"A
grader that itself needed a model would have the failure mode it exists to
detect."* Today's runs bear it out — the deterministic checks caught
sonnet-5 fabricating a quotation. So three lines are drawn here and none of
them should be crossed casually:

1. **`check_answer` is not touched.** It stays pure, exact, and dependency
   free. Its warnings remain facts.
2. **These findings are opinions, and are labelled as such.** Mixing a
   model's judgement into a list of verified facts would devalue the facts,
   which are the more useful half.
3. **This is never an eval grader.** The harness keeps deciding with
   patterns, or it stops being able to measure the thing it exists for.

The strongest version of this uses a dedicated NLI cross-encoder —
DeBERTa-MNLI and its relatives — which is small, fast, and crucially from a
different model family than whatever wrote the answer. That independence is
most of the value. It needs PyTorch, which on this project's Windows/AMD
target means CPU-only and a heavy dependency, so `llm_entailer.py` ships
first and the interface leaves room for the better one.

#: at the end of the text, or followed by whitespace and something that
#: starts a sentence — a capital, a quote, a bracket, or the `[n]` marker of
#: a trailing citation.
#:
#: It splits on *fewer* things than a full stop, on purpose. The rule this
#: replaced was `[^.!?]+(?:[.!?]+|$)`, which broke at every full stop,
#: including the ones inside `Section 4.2`, `164.308(a)(3)`, `45 C.F.R.`,
#: `Rev. 5`, `e.g.` and `99.9%`. Each break cost two things and only one of
#: them was visible: the judge was handed a fragment like `2 of the Standard`
#: and reported it unsupported, which shows up as a false finding — and the
#: claim the fragment was carved out of was never judged at all, which shows
#: up as nothing. **A claim that is never examined looks exactly like a claim
#: that passed.** Measured over a real run: of 43 findings whose text could be
#: parsed, 19 were fragments.
#:
#: So the failure direction is chosen. Under-splitting merges two sentences
#: into one unit, and the claim is still judged, just in a coarser chunk.
#: Over-splitting drops claims silently. Fewer, whole claims beats more,
#: broken ones. A legal reference is the case to design against rather than
#: a decimal: `45 C.F.R. 164.312` is how every HIPAA citation is written, so
#: a rule that special-cased digit-dot-digit would leave the framework this
#: tool exists to handle still broken while looking fixed. `_segments` adds
#: one exception to this pattern, for an initial followed by a capital.
