"""Gate a model-written parser before it runs, and run it once under watch.

`generate-parser` asks a model to write a loader for a licensed framework
export, and the sample export is part of that prompt. That makes the sample
untrusted input to a prompt whose output is code this project will import
and execute — over the very licensed file it parses. A tampered CSV, or one
a colleague pasted a chat transcript into, can steer the model toward a
loader that sends the export somewhere, and `ast.parse` was the only check
between that output and `src/`. It proves the output is Python. It proves
nothing else.

Two checks replace it, in the order a reviewer would want them:

* **Static, over the AST** (`check_generated_parser`). An allowlist of
  imports rather than a denylist: a parser needs to read a CSV or a workbook
  and nothing more, so what it may import is a short list and what it must
  not is unbounded. Calls that turn strings into code or attribute lookups,
  reach through dunder attributes, or write anything are refused by name.
  It is the walk `tests/test_byoc_boundary.py` already runs over the
  hand-written loaders, applied at the one point where the code is not
  hand-written.
* **Dynamic, in a child process** (`trial_run`). The candidate runs once
  against the sample under a PEP 578 audit hook that refuses sockets,
  subprocesses and any file opened for writing, and the number of records
  it returns is reported before anything is promoted into the package.

Neither is a sandbox, and neither is described as one. Code clever enough
can be written around a static check, and an audit hook runs inside the
interpreter it watches. What the two together change is the default: model
output used to land in `src/` and be imported on the next run; now it lands
in `output/`, is checked, is run once under watch, and reaches the package
only when somebody says so.
