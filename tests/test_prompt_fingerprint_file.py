"""The two prompt records (#236).

`evals/prompt-fingerprints.json` is the newest MEASUREMENTS.md epoch's
fingerprints, by the runner's own definition. It lags on purpose, so it is
held to its SHAPE only: it names the epoch, the PR, the pull ref and the
commits the epoch ran at.

`evals/prompt-versions.json` is the version ledger, and it is held EQUAL to
the registry: every prompt's current version is recorded, and a version
keeps one text for life. That is the guard for #117's shape (text changed,
version kept). It sits on the ledger rather than the epoch file because the
epoch file only catches the first unbumped edit after each epoch (1d on
#236); the two-edit test below is the case that tells them apart.
