"""Confluence export — a secondary, additional feature layered on top of
the canonical markdown output, not an independent generation path.

This module takes the *already-generated, already-quality-checked* markdown
from generate/policy_writer.py and converts it to Confluence storage
format, then optionally publishes via the Confluence REST API. It does not
call the LLM and does not regenerate content — that guarantees the
markdown and Confluence versions of a document can't drift from each other
in substance, only in formatting.

This module originally evaluated (and briefly used) the `md2cf` package for
both jobs, per this module's original TODO. It was dropped: md2cf pins
every one of its own dependencies to an exact, years-old version —
`mistune==0.8.4` (dozens of known CVEs) and `requests==2.31.0` (known
CVEs) among them — which is exactly what this repo's own `pip-audit` gate
exists to catch. Instead:

- `markdown_to_confluence` renders with `markdown-it-py` (already a
  maintained transitive dependency via `mdformat`) plus a small custom
  renderer subclass that only needs to special-case fenced code blocks
  (Confluence's `code` macro) — every other CommonMark/GFM construct this
  project's generated output uses (headings, paragraphs, emphasis, lists,
  tables, links, inline code) renders to valid Confluence storage format
  (an XHTML dialect) via markdown-it-py's default HTML output, unmodified.
- `export_to_confluence` calls the Confluence Content REST API directly via
  `requests`, with no dependency pinned to a specific vulnerable version.

Confluence API credentials are read from environment variables only,
matching the pattern in llm/anthropic_provider.py — never from a committed
config file.

    *editing what is already there*: between reading the page and writing it
    back, someone else may have edited it, and blindly incrementing would
    discard their change without either party noticing.

    surfaced as `ConcurrentEditError` rather than a bare HTTP error, because
