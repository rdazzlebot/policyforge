"""Cross-framework control crosswalk.

Builds a NIST-800-53-anchored table of which controls in other frameworks
correspond to each NIST control, the way the source vault's synthesis docs
do it: `{nist_control_id: {framework: [equivalent_ids]}}`.

Two sources of crosswalk data are folded together:

1. A NIST control's own `source_crosswalk` (populated by
   `ingest/nist_vault_loader.py` from its "Cross-Framework Mappings" table).
2. A non-NIST control's `source_crosswalk`, if it happens to point back at a
   NIST control ID (e.g. a FedRAMP control loaded independently that
   declares its own NIST equivalent).

Both are read at the enhancement level as well as the control level: a
framework may publish its crosswalk against sub-requirements rather than
(or as well as) top-level controls. NIST's own HIPAA-to-800-53 crosswalk
does exactly this, mapping each Required/Addressable implementation
specification separately from its parent Standard, so an enhancement's
mapping is recorded under the enhancement's own ID rather than folded into
its parent's.

Crosswalk cell values are free text (e.g. "AC-2 (same ID)", "AC-2, AC-3"),
so IDs are extracted with a regex rather than assumed to be a single clean
token.

HITRUST_SOURCE_ALIASES = FRAMEWORK_ALIASES

#: Which framework is NIST 800-53 proper, and so may anchor a row of the
#: crosswalk. The crosswalk is 800-53-anchored by construction, and an
#: identifier from any other source is not an anchor no matter how much it
#: looks like one.
#:
#: This was `"nist"` until the NIST family got one key each. A bare `nist`
#: cannot be the anchor any more, and not only for tidiness: while 800-53
#: was filed under it, `resolve_framework` found `nist` in the index and
#: returned it before its own ambiguity rule could run, so a citation
#: reading `[NIST AC-2]` resolved to 800-53 by short-circuit rather than
#: because anything had established which NIST catalog was meant.
NIST_ANCHOR = "nist-800-53"

#: The frameworks a **topic registry** may anchor identifiers from.
#:
#: **This is a different concept from `NIST_ANCHOR` above, and they were one
#: constant until 2026-09-20.** Keeping them apart is the whole point of
#: this definition, so the distinction is worth stating precisely:
#:
#:     NIST_ANCHOR    the crosswalk anchor - what every other framework's
#:                    requirements are mapped ONTO. Singular by
#:                    construction: an overlay row asserts "this
#:                    requirement and that control are the same
#:                    obligation", which needs one side to be fixed.
#:
#:     TOPIC_ANCHORS  which catalogs a topic may claim ids from. A set,
#:                    because a programme can be organised around more
#:                    than one catalog without either becoming the thing
#:                    the other maps onto.
#:
#: **Why the split is safety-critical rather than tidiness.** The obvious
#: way to let topics anchor a second catalog is to grep `NIST_ANCHOR` and
#: widen it. That also widens the crosswalk-anchor sites, and a catalog
#: that becomes a crosswalk *target* becomes something `crosswalk seed`
#: will happily generate a mapping for. For the AI RMF that mapping is
#: refused on product grounds -- it would assert an 800-53 control
#: ACHIEVES an AI RMF outcome, the claim NIST declined to make when it
#: split the Playbook out. So the natural refactor silently publishes the
#: thing we decided not to publish, while looking like the change that was
#: asked for.
#:
#: Widening THIS set cannot do that. Every site is consciously assigned to
#: one concept or the other, and `test_anchor_concepts.py` holds the
#: assignment: it widens `TOPIC_ANCHORS` and requires that seeding a
#: crosswalk stays refused.
#:
#: The AI RMF joined on 2026-09-20, on the user's decision, so a topic can
#: anchor `Govern 1` and have its documents genuinely cite the framework.
#: **Adding a catalog here grows `/coverage`'s denominator**, because its
#: requirements become things a topic could own and therefore things a
#: topic can fail to own. That is a real report rather than a regression,
#: but it must be read as one -- the report names the catalogs in scope for
#: exactly that reason.
TOPIC_ANCHORS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({NIST_ANCHOR, "nist-ai-rmf"})

#: The value `ANCHOR_DECISIONS` gives a catalog that topics may anchor.
ANCHORS = "anchors"

#: **Every catalog's answer to "may a topic anchor it?", written down** (#175).
#: Keyed by catalog DIRECTORY -- the unit someone adds -- bundled and
#: bring-your-own alike. The value is `ANCHORS`, or the reason it is not.
#:
#: Adding a catalog forced four declarations (bundled or BYOC, licence, alias,
#: README row) and never this one, which is the one that decides whether its
#: requirements enter `/coverage`'s denominator and whether synthesis can
#: retrieve them. Wrong either way, it fails silently: omitted, and the catalog
#: is inert (#171); included, and every user's coverage figure moves for a
#: framework they never adopted (#169). `test_anchor_decisions.py` derives the
#: catalog population from `data/frameworks/` and the scaffold lists and
#: refuses a catalog with no entry here, an entry for no catalog, and any
#: disagreement with `TOPIC_ANCHORS`.
#:
#: The reasons record the state as of 2026-09-24, drawn from the rulings on
#: each catalog's issue; changing one is a product decision (80), not an edit.
