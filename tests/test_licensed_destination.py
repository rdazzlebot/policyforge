"""A licensed BYOC catalog may only be written where the model boundary will
read it as licensed (#459, 80's ruling (a)).

The boundary (`llm/boundary.classify_path`) knows a licensed catalog by where
it sits. `etl-hitrust --out output/...` used to pass the write guard, which
asked only whether git would stage the file, and the catalog then classified
as organization-internal, which a hosted model may read. Measured on #459.

Every case runs through both ETLs that share the guard, from a project
directory, since the boundary reads its search paths relative to it.
