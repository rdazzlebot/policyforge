"""Cross-framework control crosswalk.

Builds a NIST-800-53-anchored table of which controls in other frameworks
correspond to each NIST control, the way the source vault's synthesis docs
do it: `{nist_control_id: {framework: [equivalent_ids]}}`.

Two sources of crosswalk data are folded together:

1. A NIST control's own `source_crosswalk` (populated by
   `ingest/nist_vault_loader.py` from its "Cross-Framework Mappings" table).
2. A non-NIST control's `source_crosswalk`, if it happens to point back at a
   NIST control ID (e.g. a FedRAMP control loaded independently that
   declares its own NIST equivalent).

Both are read at the enhancement level as well as the control level: a
framework may publish its crosswalk against sub-requirements rather than
(or as well as) top-level controls. NIST's own HIPAA-to-800-53 crosswalk
does exactly this, mapping each Required/Addressable implementation
specification separately from its parent Standard, so an enhancement's
mapping is recorded under the enhancement's own ID rather than folded into
its parent's.

Crosswalk cell values are free text (e.g. "AC-2 (same ID)", "AC-2, AC-3"),
so IDs are extracted with a regex rather than assumed to be a single clean
token.

    uses internally.

    This used to be the first word, and that was the defect. "NIST" alone
    spans 800-53, 800-171, 800-172, 800-137 and the Cybersecurity

    requirement identifiers merged into one set. An 800-171 identifier
    cited as 800-53 was then *found* in that shared bucket and counted as
    evidence rather than reported as unknown — a citation resolving to the
    wrong catalog, silently, which for a tool an assessor reads is the one
    failure mode this project exists to prevent.

    The reasoning had already been done and written down, one function
    below, for the HITRUST path: *folding those together would file CSF
    outcome ids as 800-53 controls*. It simply never reached the catalog
    path. So both now share `FRAMEWORK_ALIASES`, and there is one
    definition of what a framework name keys to instead of two that
    disagree.

    The first word remains the fallback, which is what keeps every catalog

#: "NIST" alone spans 800-53, 800-171, 800-172, 800-137 and the Cybersecurity
#: Framework, whose identifiers look nothing alike: `AC-2`, `03.01.01`,

#: The old name, kept because the table's first readers were the HITRUST

#: crosswalk. The crosswalk is 800-53-anchored by construction, and an
#: identifier from any other source is not an anchor no matter how much it
#: looks like one.
#:
#: This was `"nist"` until the NIST family got one key each. A bare `nist`
#: cannot be the anchor any more, and not only for tidiness: while 800-53
#: was filed under it, `resolve_framework` found `nist` in the index and
#: returned it before its own ambiguity rule could run, so a citation
#: reading `[NIST AC-2]` resolved to 800-53 by short-circuit rather than
#: because anything had established which NIST catalog was meant.
NIST_ANCHOR = "nist-800-53"

#: The frameworks a **topic registry** may anchor identifiers from.
#:
#: **This is a different concept from `NIST_ANCHOR` above, and they were one
#: constant until 2026-09-20.** Keeping them apart is the whole point of
#: this definition, so the distinction is worth stating precisely:
#:
#:     NIST_ANCHOR    the crosswalk anchor - what every other framework's
#:                    requirements are mapped ONTO. Singular by
#:                    construction: an overlay row asserts "this
#:                    requirement and that control are the same
#:                    obligation", which needs one side to be fixed.
#:
#:     TOPIC_ANCHORS  which catalogs a topic may claim ids from. A set,
#:                    because a programme can be organised around more
#:                    than one catalog without either becoming the thing
#:                    the other maps onto.
#:
#: **Why the split is safety-critical rather than tidiness.** The obvious
#: way to let topics anchor a second catalog is to grep `NIST_ANCHOR` and
#: widen it. That also widens the crosswalk-anchor sites, and a catalog
#: that becomes a crosswalk *target* becomes something `crosswalk seed`
#: will happily generate a mapping for. For the AI RMF that mapping is
#: refused on product grounds -- it would assert an 800-53 control
#: ACHIEVES an AI RMF outcome, the claim NIST declined to make when it
#: split the Playbook out. So the natural refactor silently publishes the
#: thing we decided not to publish, while looking like the change that was
#: asked for.
#:
#: Widening THIS set cannot do that. Every site is consciously assigned to
#: one concept or the other, and `test_anchor_concepts.py` holds the
#: assignment: it widens `TOPIC_ANCHORS` and requires that seeding a
#: crosswalk stays refused.
#:
#: The AI RMF joined on 2026-09-20, on the user's decision, so a topic can
#: anchor `Govern 1` and have its documents genuinely cite the framework.
#: **Adding a catalog here grows `/coverage`'s denominator**, because its
#: requirements become things a topic could own and therefore things a
#: topic can fail to own. That is a real report rather than a regression,
#: but it must be read as one -- the report names the catalogs in scope for
#: exactly that reason.
