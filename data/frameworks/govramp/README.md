# GovRAMP

**Not bundled here.** GovRAMP's Terms & Conditions claim ownership of
"documents, downloadable files" published on their site, and no
redistribution license was found. Treat GovRAMP as BYOC (like HITRUST)
until GovRAMP grants explicit permission — see the licensing table in the
top-level README.

Bring your own matrix instead:

```bash
policyforge etl-govramp --export local_content/govramp/GovRAMP-Controls-Matrix_Mod_Rev5_V1.06.xlsx
```

`local_content/` is gitignored. The command parses in memory and prints what
it found; it writes nothing unless you pass `--out`.

If you email GovRAMP for permission (info@govramp.org) and they grant it,
this is the directory to populate afterward.

## If your own repository may hold it

Same arrangement as HITRUST. Your own use of the matrix very likely permits
your *private* repository to carry it, even though this public one cannot.
That is a decision only the repository owner can make, so it is declared
rather than assumed — in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
frameworks:
  allow_licensed_in_repo: true    # our reading of GovRAMP's terms permits this
```

Then write the parsed catalog into your own tree:

```bash
policyforge etl-govramp \
  --export local_content/govramp/GovRAMP-Controls-Matrix_Mod_Rev5_V1.06.xlsx \
  --out frameworks/govramp/controls.json
```

and declare it beside the data, so `policyforge check` knows what it is:

```yaml
# frameworks/govramp/framework.yaml
id: govramp
name: GovRAMP Rev 5 (Moderate)
licence: licensed
source: GovRAMP controls matrix, published workbook
version: Rev 5 (V1.06)
```

Without that declaration a framework directory is *treated* as licensed
anyway — assuming content is freely redistributable because nobody said
otherwise is the failure mode with consequences.

## Which file to export

There is nothing to export: GovRAMP publishes the matrix as a workbook, and
`etl-govramp` reads it as published. Hand it the `.xlsx` (or `.xlsm`) whole —
the controls sheet is found among the template's other thirteen by its
header captions, so the Low, Moderate and High workbooks all read without
being told which they are, and a renumbered sheet in a later revision needs
no code change.

Two things are worth knowing about the file:

- **It is an SSP template, not a data export.** Most of its sheets are blank
  grids for a service provider to fill in. Only the controls sheet is read;
  the Control Implementation Summary and Control Responsibility Matrix carry
  nothing but zeros in a fresh template and are deliberately not ingested.
- **The impact level and revision come from the cover sheet**, falling back
  to the filename. Both are the first things edited once somebody starts
  working in the template, so `--impact-level` and `--version` override them.

If detection fails on your workbook's shape it will say which columns it
could not find, and
`policyforge generate-parser --framework govramp --sample <path>` drafts a
loader for that specific file.

## What it looks like once parsed

See [the structure section][structure] in the top-level README, and
`src/policyforge/ingest/govramp.py` for the long form: GovRAMP is a profile
over 800-53 rather than a catalog of its own, carrying the parameter values
it has already decided and the requirements it layers on top, across three
verification tiers — Core, Ready, Authorized — which nest inside each other
and are *not* the same axis as the Low/Moderate/High impact level of the
workbook they live in.
