"""A billed request is in the ledger even when its call then fails (#343).

After #366 the success path kept every billed attempt: the row's cost is the
summed cost and the first attempt is in `escalations`. The failure paths lost
money:
- a re-send that came back empty again raised `ReasoningBudgetExhausted`,
  and the row had `cost_usd` None and no request id: the re-send's cost
  (b5 measured the shape at up to $1.30) and its id were recorded nowhere;
- a cascade caught that exhaustion and escalated, so the row carried only
  the stronger model's cost, and the primary's re-send vanished again.

**The conservation check below is the point**: in every scenario, where
every attempt reports a cost, the row's cost is the total the fakes billed,
and every billed request id is on the row or in its escalations. A path
that loses a request fails it. Where an attempt's cost is unknown, the
row's cost is None (the tests after it).
