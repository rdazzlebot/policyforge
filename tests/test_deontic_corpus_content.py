"""The generated corpus in `tests/fixtures/deontic_corpus/` holds only text
generated from public-domain catalogs (80's ruling on #376).

No HITRUST, GovRAMP or SOC 2 text, verbatim or paraphrased, and no licensed
framework's name. The repository is public, and licensed content is never
bundled, fixtures included. Every guard here is shown failing on a planted
line before its zero over the corpus is trusted.

**What this cannot see:** licensed text paraphrased with none of the names,
ids or phrases below. The stronger evidence is how the corpus was made: from
the bundled public-domain catalogs only (the fixture's README).
