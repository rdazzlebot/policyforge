"""A per-organization crosswalk file, applied over a catalog's published mapping.

The published HIPAA-to-800-53 crosswalk is a list of pairs. It has no
relationship type and no rationale, several requirements map to twenty
controls or more, and it is stored inside the catalog's `controls.json` —
so re-running `etl-hipaa` wipes it, and an organization that disagrees with
a pair has nowhere to say so that survives the next ETL.

An overlay is that somewhere. One YAML file per framework, in the
organization's repository next to its parameter ledger:

    framework: HIPAA Security Rule
    anchor: nist
    requirements:
      164.308(a)(5)(ii)(B):
        - control: SI-3
          relationship: subset
          status: accepted
          sources: [cprt, model]
          evidence:
            requirement: guarding against, detecting, and reporting malicious software
            control: implement malicious code protection mechanisms
          rationale: SI-3 is the detection half; reporting is IR-6.
          proposed_by: {model: glm-5.3-flash, prompt: crosswalk.propose v1 1a2b3c4d5e6f}
          reviewed_by: {who: ryan, date: 2026-09-17}

**Only accepted rows reach the pipeline.** A requirement the overlay lists
has its mapping *replaced* by that requirement's accepted rows — a rejected
pair is gone, an added one is present, a proposed one waits. A requirement
the overlay does not list keeps the catalog's mapping, so a partial overlay
is a safe one: reviewing ten requirements does not unmap the other sixty.

**Stale is reported, not dropped.** A requirement id or a control id the
catalog no longer has is listed by `check_overlay`, the same way the
parameter ledger treats a key that matches nothing: a catalog revision
surfaces as a question rather than a lost decision.
