"""A command the product prints must be one a person can actually run.

Three ways a printed command fails, and this project has now produced all
three:

- **its context differs from the reader's** — `/coverage` printed
  `crosswalk seed --framework 'NIST 800-171'`, which worked in the shell
  that printed it and exited 1 from the CLI's own default catalogs;
- **it does not survive a shell** — the same fix then emitted Windows
  backslashes, which bash eats as escapes;
- **an interpolated value breaks the quoting** — the subject of #187.

A printed command is a promise. It is also the one kind of output nothing
here executes, so nothing here notices when it stops being true.

    green, and a real bare interpolation placed beyond the narrowed span
    is not caught.** A guard reporting `clean` over a population it
    quietly halved is worse than no guard, because it is the sentence
    that stops the next person looking. #228.

    **Pinned by members rather than by cardinality, and that is the part
    that matters.** `assert len(found) == 14` is edited to `== 11` in one

    the same reason `ILLUSTRATIVE_COMMANDS` above is keyed by the command
    and not by `path:line`.

    **Why a pin at all, when `shell_status.py` needs none.** That guard
    has a second derivation — files signalled by a cruder scan — in the

    derivation: 9b measured that a text census finds 3 modules where the

    continuation lines** — the two the AST exists for. A cruder second
    derivation in the same dimension is not independent, it is just
    wrong in the direction that hides the shrink. So this is pinned, and
    the cost is that a legitimate new printed command turns it red once.

    Measured: dropping one interpolation from `cli/content.py`, which has
    four, takes the population 14 -> 13 and leaves the set of modules at
    five. A module-level check misses that; this names
    `policyforge/cli/content.py: shlex.quote(tier)`.

    The module is used rather than `path:line`: a line number moves under
    an edit above it, and this file has already gone red once on a merge
