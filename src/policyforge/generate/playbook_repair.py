"""Repair a Standard's Playbook sentences, or refuse to hand it back (#301).

A Standard for an AI topic carries one "NIST suggests ..." sentence per Core
subcategory its topic anchors, citing the Playbook actions it summarises.
Measured on production models (#301), a first draft can fail that in two
ways a reader cannot see without the check: a sentence the Playbook gate
refuses (sonnet paraphrased NIST's "will need to be ... decommissioned" as
"must be decommissioned"), and a subcategory with no sentence at all (glm
left out Map 5.1). **80's ruling: regenerate what fails, with bounded
retries, and if it still fails, refuse loudly rather than write a document
that `policyforge check` will reject.**

**Generic over the gate.** A problem is whatever the gate reports --
`deontic.playbook_obligations` and `deontic.playbook_tagged_headings` -- plus
a subcategory with no sentence or the wrong action count. Nothing here
re-implements a gate rule, so a rule added to the gate (#337, #340, #341)
becomes something this repairs without a change here.

**What it changes, and what it cannot.** A failing sentence is replaced by
line, and only when every Playbook citation on that line is for the one
subcategory being repaired; a line mixing subcategories is left and
reported. A missing sentence is appended under one closing section, not
placed beside related text. A Playbook tag on a heading is removed from the
heading without a model call, since the rule is simply that headings carry
none. Every other line of the draft is returned byte-for-byte.
