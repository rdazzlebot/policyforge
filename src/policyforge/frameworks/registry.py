"""Where framework content lives, and who is allowed to hold a copy of it.

Some of the catalogs this project maps between are public-domain government
works and some are licensed. That is not a detail of packaging — it decides
which repository a file may sit in, and getting it wrong is a licence
breach rather than a bug.

The arrangement this supports has two repositories with different rights:

* **This one** is open, Apache-licensed, and may hold only content anyone
  may redistribute: NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, ARC-AMPE, the HIPAA Security Rule.
  A HITRUST CSF export must never be committed here, and `local_content/` is
  gitignored precisely so an accidental copy cannot be.
* **The organization's own repository** — private, holding its `docs/` tree,
  its `topics.yaml`, its config — very often *may* hold that same HITRUST
  export, because its own MyCSF licence permits internal use. Telling that
  organization to keep its licensed catalog outside its own private repo,
  when the licence allows it, is a restriction this project has no standing
  to impose and which makes CI harder for no benefit.

So the rule cannot be "licensed content never goes in a repo". It has to be
"licensed content never goes in a repo that has not said it may hold it",
and that is a decision only the repository owner can make. They make it once,
in config:

    frameworks:
      allow_licensed_in_repo: true    # our MyCSF licence permits this

This project's own config does not set it, so `policyforge check` fails here
the moment licensed content is committed — while the same command passes in
a repository whose owner has declared the right. The mechanism is a declared
permission rather than a path convention, because a path convention is a
thing you can forget and a failing check is not.

**What is not decided here.** Whether a *generated document* citing
`[HITRUST 01.c]` may be redistributed is a question about identifiers,
paraphrase and fair use that depends on the licence and the jurisdiction,
and this tool has no business answering it. What it can do is tell you which
of your documents drew on licensed material — see `derived_from` — so the
question is asked about the right files by someone qualified to answer it.
