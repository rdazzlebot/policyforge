"""Text this tool writes ends its lines with LF on every platform.

`Path.write_text` opens the file in text mode with universal newlines, and
on Windows that turns every `\\n` into `\\r\\n` on the way out. Every
markdown writer here passed `encoding="utf-8"` and none passed `newline`,
so a Standard drafted on Windows, a page pulled from Confluence on Windows,
or a revision `edit-topic --apply` wrote into `docs/` arrived with CRLF —
and `mdformat`, which the repository's own gate runs over every markdown
file, rejects any file containing a CR. The tool produced files its own
check then failed on, and only on the platform the check could not see
from CI. `.gitattributes` fixes what git checks *out*; it says nothing
about what a program writes, and `output/` is not tracked at all.

One function rather than a `newline=` argument at each site, because the
site that forgets is the one that ships. `tests/test_lf_output.py` holds
the writers to it.
