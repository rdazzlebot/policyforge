"""The gate's exit rule: a check that did not run is not a check that passed.

`scripts/check.py` used to compute its exit code as `if passed is False`,
so a skipped check — `None` — left the result untouched and the script
exited 0. A machine missing both optional tools printed seven passes and a
green exit, and two of the nine checks were the security ones (semgrep's
SAST, gitleaks' secrets scan). Three sessions reported "gate exit 0" as
evidence a branch was safe to push while gitleaks had never run.

These tests exist because the defect is invisible in the output it
produces: a summary of passes is exactly what a successful run looks like.
