"""Turn a plain-language instruction into a reviewable plan of edits.

This is the first half of the Confluence editing harness: given what someone
wants changed and the page as it stands, produce a structured list of the
edits that would satisfy the request — *before* any content is rewritten and
long before anything is published.

Why plan and execute are two separate LLM calls rather than one rewrite:

* **The plan is the review surface.** These are governance documents. A
  reviewer can read six plan steps in a few seconds and catch "you're about
  to delete the exceptions section" far more reliably than by diffing a
  regenerated page.
* **Rejecting a bad plan is cheap.** A wrong plan costs one call to notice;
  a wrong rewrite costs a careful read of the whole document to notice.
* **It leaves an audit trail.** The plan records what was asked, what the
  model intended, and what it explicitly declined to do — which is exactly
  the provenance a change to a live policy page needs.

The planner is deliberately allowed to refuse. An instruction that would
weaken a stated requirement, drop a framework citation, or that simply isn't
answerable from the page's own content belongs in `out_of_scope` with a
reason, not silently attempted.

Rules:
- Ground every step in the document you are given. `target` must name a
  heading that actually appears in it, or the literal string "document".
  Never plan an edit to a section that isn't there — plan an "add" instead.
- Only plan what the instruction asks for. Do not opportunistically improve,
  reformat, restructure or "tidy" anything you were not asked to change.
- These documents carry inline source tags like `[NIST AC-2 | HIPAA
  164.308(a)(3)(i)]` that trace requirements back to the frameworks they came
  from. Never plan to remove or alter one. If satisfying the instruction
  would require dropping a citation, put that in `out_of_scope` instead.
- If the instruction would weaken, remove or narrow a stated requirement, do
  not quietly plan it. Put it in `risks` with what would be lost, so a person
  decides.
- If part of the instruction is ambiguous, or cannot be answered from this
  document's own content, put it in `out_of_scope` with the reason rather
  than guessing at what was meant.
- An instruction that needs no change to this document is a valid outcome:
  return an empty `steps` list and say why in `out_of_scope`.
