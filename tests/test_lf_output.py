"""Markdown this tool writes carries no CR, on any platform.

`Path.write_text` translates `\\n` to the platform's line separator, so on
Windows every markdown writer that passed `encoding="utf-8"` and nothing
else produced CRLF — and `mdformat`, which the repository's gate runs over
every markdown file, rejects a CR. Generated Standards, pulled pages and
applied revisions all failed a check the tool itself had just written the
input for, on the one platform CI does not run.

Two kinds of test. The behavioural ones write through the real writers and
read the bytes back; on Windows they failed before `textfile.write_text_lf`
existed. The structural one walks the writers' source and refuses a direct
`write_text` call, because the behavioural tests cover the writers that are
cheap to call and the site that forgets is the one that ships.
