Written with the catalog rather than after someone blocked a PR for it.
The HIPAA version of this test was written two hours after a change
falsified five statements in a file that ships in the wheel; the Part 2
version was written two hours before that and not carried across. A guard
scoped to the catalog you happen to be thinking about is the recurring
shape, so this one is written at the same time as the thing it guards.
