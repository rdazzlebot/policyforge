"""A requested eval suite that contributes nothing is named, not dropped (#223).

Both guards used to run over the union. `if not planned` in the harness was
satisfied by any one suite's cases, and `format_report` skipped a suite with
no results. So a run of routing and synthesis, with synthesis empty,
produced a clean routing report whose totals were true about what ran and
silent about what did not. That report is what becomes an epoch.

**The dangerous case is the partial one**, some suites present and one
empty, because an empty run already fails loudly. So that is the case
seeded here, and each guard also gets a passing arm: a guard that refuses
every run passes a refusal test just as well.

**Assert the suite LINE, not the word.** The report prints each prompt's
provenance, and `synthesis.merge` is one of them, so "synthesis" appears
in a report that never ran the synthesis suite. Measured while filing
this, and it is why these tests match `synthesis: NOT RUN` at the start
of a line.
