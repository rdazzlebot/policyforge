"""How hard a model should think, chosen per call site.

The token budgets in `zardoz/budgets.py` exist because of a shape this
project measured rather than guessed: a reasoning model spends its ceiling
thinking before a one-word answer, so a routing call asking for a single
word needed 800 tokens of headroom and still came back empty one time in
eight. `_anthropic_compat` carries a retry for the same reason, at eight
times the budget.

Both are workarounds for the wrong lever. On current Claude models thinking
is adaptive and `output_config.effort` is the dial: how much the model
spends deliberating is the thing to set, not how much room its deliberation
is allowed to consume. Effort is per request, so it belongs at the call
site — the same request that knows whether it is routing a question or
drafting a Standard.

The tiers below are the ones the budgets already expressed. A call that
picks one word from a closed list, rewrites a question, or lists search
terms is `LOW`. A call that writes a document somebody will be audited
against is `HIGH`.

Nothing here lowers a budget. The budgets were measured, and changing them
is a measured change: `MEASUREMENTS.md` epoch 2 records what happened when
they were set too tight, and the same evidence is owed before setting them
back down. Effort goes in first, and the budgets come down when a sweep says
they can.

    A provider may retry on its own first: the Anthropic shim and the
