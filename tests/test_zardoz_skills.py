"""Zardoz's analyses: questions about the programme, not about its prose.

Half the questions people have are not answerable from any document, because
they are questions *about* the programme. Which controls nobody owns. What
the catalog changed. How many values are still undecided. Nothing in a
Standard states any of that.

The property that matters here is the division of labour: **the model routes
and the report speaks**. A model that read "14 orphaned" and told you about
it could say "mostly in the audit family" with nothing to check it against.
So the tests assert that a skill's output arrives byte-for-byte, that a
routing failure falls back to the documents rather than to an error, and
that the shell says which analysis it ran so a wrong route is visible.
