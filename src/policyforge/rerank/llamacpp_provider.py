"""Scores passages with a cross-encoder served by llama.cpp's `llama-server`.

Chosen because it needs nothing this project does not already have. A
machine running Ollama already has the binary — AMD's bundle ships it at
`lib/ollama/llama-server.exe` — and the reranker is one flag:

    llama-server -m bge-reranker-v2-m3-Q4_K_M.gguf --reranking --port 8090

That avoids the alternative, which is `sentence-transformers` and therefore
PyTorch: a large dependency with no ROCm build for Windows, so it would run
on the CPU anyway while costing gigabytes.

Two things learned setting this up, both worth not rediscovering:

- **`-hf` does not work on AMD's build.** It is compiled without SSL, so
  fetching from Hugging Face fails with "HTTPS is not supported" and the
  server then dies loading a model path of `''`. Download the GGUF with
  curl and pass `-m`.
- **`/health` returns OK while the model is still loading**, and calls made
  in that window come back `503 Loading model`. Loading takes a few seconds;
  `check()` below treats a 503 as "not ready" rather than as failure.

Every request goes through a `Channel`, like the embedder's: the question and
every candidate passage are checked against the boundary before they are
sent, and the batch is recorded in the ledger once it has been.
