"""Is every obligation in a generated document backed by its synthesis?

`check.py:_check_citations` verifies that the *citations* in a synthesis
survive into the document it produced. Nothing verifies that the *content*
does. `evals/runner._tags` compares control **references** — so it asks
*"does this document cite what the synthesis cited, and nothing more?"* and
never *"does this document say what the synthesis said?"* — and a
requirement written under a tag the synthesis genuinely carries would be
indistinguishable from one the synthesis wrote (#174).

Two findings come out of that, and **they are different kinds of claim**:

- **Unanchored** — a binding sentence with no citation, in a section whose
  other sentences have one. Deterministic, free, and a **fact**: the
  document either says it or it does not, and the answer is the same twice.
- **Ungrounded** — a cited binding sentence its own synthesis requirements
  do not carry. A model's **opinion**, costing one call per sentence.

**Only the first may gate an exit code.** That is the product ruling on
#196: a malformed document is a fact anyone can verify with the same result
twice; a model's verdict can differ between runs on identical input, and
putting the second behind the same number as the first changes what a
non-zero exit means for every caller that already relies on it. The second
half is a report, and it is the half #174 leaves open rather than closes.

**The tag is an index here, not the assertion.** That is the whole upgrade
over comparing reference sets.

**Results are structured, and any string a caller matches on is derived from
them rather than parsed back out.** `_entailment_warnings` returns formatted
strings that `evals/runner.py` recovers with `startswith(PREFIX)`; change the
wording and the filter stops matching, the harness reports zero findings and
looks healthy. That is the same shape as a regex that cannot match, and it
is why nothing here travels as prose.
