"""Passages that address the answerer rather than the organization.

Two halves, tested differently.

The **fence** is structural and can be asserted outright: a passage cannot
close a delimiter it could not know, so the tests here are about what a
document can and cannot do to the shape of the request. That is the half
that actually holds, and it holds regardless of what any model does with it.

The **detector** is a heuristic, and the only honest way to test a heuristic
is on both sides at once. A security policy set is imperative from end to
end — "Accounts must be recertified quarterly", "Do not share credentials",
"Revoke the badge" — so a detector that fired on commanding language would
report every document in the corpus, which is the same as reporting nothing.
Every attack case below is paired with policy prose that shares its
vocabulary, because the pair is the claim: it is the audience that separates
an injected instruction from a requirement, not the mood.
