"""Parse NIST's official OSCAL edition of SP 800-53 into this project's
common Control/ControlEnhancement schema.

`ingest/nist_vault_loader.py` parses one specific Obsidian vault's markdown
notes, which makes it useful only to someone who already has that vault.
This loader reads NIST's own machine-readable catalog instead, so the
800-53 data can be populated from scratch by anyone:

    policyforge etl-oscal

Source is the `usnistgov/oscal-content` repository — the authoritative
OSCAL release of SP 800-53 Rev 5 plus the Low/Moderate/High baseline
profiles. A US government work, so public domain, same basis as the eCFR
and CPRT sources used elsewhere in `ingest/`.

OSCAL shapes that need translating into this project's flatter schema:

* **Identifiers.** OSCAL ids are lowercase and dotted (`ac-2`, `ac-2.1`).
  The human-facing label is carried in a `props` entry, and each control
  has *three* of them: a zero-padded form ("AC-02"), an SP 800-53A form,
  and the plain form NIST prints in the publication ("AC-2"). Only the
  last has no `class` key, and that's the one the rest of this codebase
  uses — see `mapping/crosswalk.py`'s ID regex.
* **Statements.** Control text is a `parts` tree, not a string: a
  `statement` part containing labelled `item` parts ("a.", "b.", then
  nested "1.", "2."). These are flattened back into readable prose with
  their labels preserved, since that lettering is what an SSP's
  implementation narrative refers to.
* **Parameters.** Prose contains `{{ insert: param, ac-02_odp.01 }}`
  placeholders. Each resolves either to an assignment (a `label`) or to a
  selection (a `select` with `choice` values), and is rendered the way NIST
  prints them: "[Assignment: organization-defined ...]" /
  "[Selection (one or more): ...]". Leaving the raw placeholders in would
  put OSCAL internals into a compliance deliverable.
* **Withdrawn controls.** 182 enhancements are marked `status: withdrawn`
  and carry no statement text. They are excluded: they aren't part of Rev 5
  any more, they appear in no baseline, and listing them in an SSP would
  invite implementation narratives for controls that no longer exist. The
  count is reported by `parse_oscal_catalog` rather than silently dropped.

**This module reads more than one NIST catalog, and they do not agree with
each other.** See `OscalDialect`: the bullet above about unclassed `label`
props is true of 800-53 and false of 800-171, where the unclassed label is
the control's *title* with the citation in brackets. Everything catalog-
specific lives in a dialect, and `parse_oscal_catalog` defaults to 800-53
so callers that predate this keep their behaviour exactly.

One visible consequence, stated so nobody "fixes" it: **800-53 statements
render `a.` and 800-171's render `a`.** That is NIST's difference, not
ours — 800-53's label prop literally contains the dot and 800-171's
segment does not. Adding one would put a character on the page that NIST
did not, in a catalog whose whole pitch is that a citation can be traced
back. The awkward line is the honest one.

    """How one NIST catalog spells the things every NIST catalog has.

    **NIST's own catalogs disagree about what an unclassed `label` prop
    holds**, and that is the whole reason this type exists. The next person
    will assume it is uniform, because the brief for 800-171 did:

        800-53 rev 5   labels: AC-01 (zero-padded), AC-1 (unclassed),
                               AC-01 (sp800-53a);  group label: "AC"

                               one;  group label: "Access Control (03.01)"

    So on 800-53 the unclassed label *is* the citation, and on 800-171 it
    is the title with the citation in brackets. Reading it the 800-53 way

    catalog whose identifiers are sentences. `OscalDialect` was added
    because of that. A dialect mismatch that instead caused controls to
    be skipped would produce a **short** catalog, and nothing in this
    module would notice — every entry in it would still be well-formed.

    Both sides come from the document: `_declared_controls` walks the
    JSON tree knowing nothing about identifiers. So there is no count to
    maintain and nothing that can go stale, which is the same argument
    `part2_loader._require_sections` makes for eCFR.
