"""`policyforge init`, and the package data it depends on.

The packaging half matters as much as the command. pyproject.toml lists the
packages and the bundled files by hand, because the catalogs are mapped in
from outside src/, and a hand-kept list is exactly what drifts: a new
subpackage left off ships an install that fails on import, and a catalog
glob would ship somebody's licensed export. These tests hold both lists to
what is actually in the repository.
