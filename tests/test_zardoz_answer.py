"""zardoz answering tests (milestone M3) — grounded, or absent.

No test calls a model. The provider interface is one method, so a fake that
returns a scripted string exercises every path that matters, and the paths
that matter are mostly the *checks* — what happens when the model cites a
passage that was never supplied, or quotes text that is not in the source.

Those checks are the point of the module. A prompt asking a model to cite
its claims is a request; verifying the citations afterwards is the only
part that holds when the request is ignored.
