"""NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 — the Core, as a control catalog.

**This catalog states OUTCOMES where every other catalog here states
obligations, and that difference is the whole reason to read this note
before citing it.**

800-53 says *the organization shall*. HIPAA says *a covered entity must*.
The AI RMF Core says things like *"the risks ... are understood and
managed"* — a state of the world a governance programme is supposed to
reach, with no sentence anywhere naming who does what. NIST publishes the
*actions* separately, in the Playbook, which is explicitly voluntary and
versioned apart from the Framework.

Two consequences, both of which bite in practice:

- **A generated document citing an AI RMF subcategory is traceable and can
  still be hollow.** `satisfies` resolves the citation, the tag is legal,
  the gate is green — and the sentence it anchors may restate the outcome
  rather than commit anyone to anything. Traceability and substance come
  apart here in a way they do not for 800-53, and no check in this project
  currently distinguishes them.
- **`satisfies` resolves an AI RMF citation and then stops, because there
  is no crosswalk.** That is not an omission to be fixed quietly: a
  crosswalk from an outcome to a control asserts that implementing the
  control *achieves* the outcome, which is exactly the claim NIST declined
  to make when it split the Playbook out. See the catalog README.

**Source is AIRC, not CPRT.** CPRT does not carry the AI RMF Core. This was
resolved by checking both; a future session should not re-litigate it.

**The declared name must be citable, which means it must not begin with a
digit.** `content/tags.SOURCE_TAG_RE` builds a framework name from
capital-initial words, so a name like `1.0 AI RMF` would not be a tag at
all — it would be prose, and a document citing this catalog would report
nothing cited while `satisfies --strict` exited 0. Two CFR catalogs shipped
in exactly that state. `NIST AI RMF` is capital-initial and safe, and
`FRAMEWORK_ALIASES` could not have rescued it otherwise: the alias table is
downstream of the pattern that failed to match.

#: AIRC's rendering of the Core. A fixed constant, deliberately: the parser
#: below is a regex over untrusted markup, and the argument that this is
#: safe rests on the bytes coming from a host we named rather than one an
#: operator or an attacker chooses. If this ever takes a supplied URL, that
#: argument lapses and has to be made again.
SOURCE_URL = "https://airc.nist.gov/airmf-resources/airmf/5-sec-core/"

FRAMEWORK = "NIST AI RMF"
FRAMEWORK_VERSION = "1.0"

#: The four functions, in the order NIST presents them. Used to validate
#: rather than to find: the parser keys on identifier *shape*, so an
#: unexpected function name surfaces as a parse error instead of being
#: silently skipped by a hard-coded list.
FUNCTIONS = ("Govern", "Map", "Measure", "Manage")

#: The Core's shape at revision 1.0, which this catalog is pinned to.
#:
#: **Parsing MORE than NIST publishes is as much a defect as parsing
#: fewer**, and the structural checks do not catch it: contiguity accepts
#: an *extension*, so an invented `Govern 7` yields 20 categories with
#: every other assertion satisfied. policyforge-9b raised this against the
#: widened row pattern and it was already true of the narrow one.
#:
#: Pinned as an exact pair rather than a floor. A page that yields a
#: different shape is either a restyle or a new revision of the Framework,
#: and **both need a person**: the first is a parser bug, the second means
#: this catalog's pin, its README and its provenance stamp are all stale.
#: Neither should be absorbed silently by a loader.
EXPECTED_SHAPE = (19, 72)

#: Abbreviations NIST uses in the Playbook and in its own crosswalks.
_FUNCTION_ABBR = {"Govern": "GV", "Map": "MP", "Measure": "MS", "Manage": "MG"}

#: **Keyed on the identifier's shape, not on a CSS class.** Class names are
#: AIRC's presentation and change without notice; `Govern 1.1` is the
#: document's own grammar and changes only when the Framework does. A
#: class-keyed parser would return zero rows on a restyle and report
#: success — the silent-empty failure this project keeps finding. The
#: structural assertions in `parse_ai_rmf` are what turn that into a crash.
#: **The function word is captured, not enumerated, and that is the whole
#: point.** It used to read `(?:Govern|Map|Measure|Manage)`, which made the
#: `unrecognised AI RMF function` guard below **unreachable** -- the regex
#: could not produce a name the guard would reject, so a fifth NIST
#: function did not raise, it **vanished**: the row failed to match at all
#: and the reader got a confusing complaint about category numbering
#: instead.
#:
#: Found by policyforge-ba, constructively: deleting each guard in turn and
#: recording which test noticed. Two noticed nothing, and this one could
#: not have. Enumerating a vocabulary inside a pattern turns "I do not
#: recognise this" into "this does not exist", which is the failure this
#: module is otherwise written against.
