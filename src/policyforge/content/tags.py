"""What a framework source tag looks like, decided once.

A generated document carries its traceability inline, as bracketed tags
after the sentence that implements a control: `[NIST AC-2 | HIPAA
164.308(a)(3)(i)]`. Four places read them — the edit path, to refuse a
revision that dropped one; `check`, to report a tag the synthesis carries
and the document lost; `frameworks/drift`, to find the documents a changed
control reaches; and the deontic analysis, to know which sentences claim to
implement something. Each had its own copy of the pattern, and every copy
was a hand-written list of framework names.

A list is the wrong shape for this. The names in a tag are chosen by the
model at generation time, by example rather than by rule, and the bundled
starter set already carries `[ARC PE-1 ...]` where the list said
`ARC-AMPE`: twenty-two tags that every one of those readers looked straight
through. `check` could not report them dropped, drift could not reach the
documents that cite them, and the counts `satisfies` prints were a floor
that said so in its docstring. Adding `ARC` to four lists fixes the tags
seen today and none of the tags a new catalog, or a model with a different
habit, writes tomorrow.

So a tag is recognised by its shape, not by a roll call:

* it opens with a framework name — one or more capitalised tokens
  (`NIST`, `ARC-AMPE`, `HIPAA Security Rule`);
* the name is followed by a requirement identifier, which is any token
  carrying a digit (`AC-2`, `164.308(a)`, `01.a`, `800-53`);
* it is not a wikilink and not the text of a markdown link.

The identifier rule is what keeps prose out. `[NIST AI RMF alignment]` and
`[NIST CAVP]` occur in this repository's own documents and were matched by
the old list as citations, which they are not; a name with nothing
number-shaped after it is a phrase in brackets. Measured over every text in
the repository before this shipped: the shape matches every tag the list
matched, adds none, and drops exactly those six phrases.

Which catalog a name points at is a separate question, answered by
`topics/satisfies.resolve_framework` against the catalogs actually loaded;
this module only says what is a tag.

One trap, named because it cost two reviewers an hour each. A placeholder
whose label opens with a framework name — `[HIPAA Documentation Review
Frequency]`, sitting mid-sentence beside `[Ticketing System]` and
`[Contract Repository]`, standing in for a value nobody has decided — looks
like a citation to anyone reasoning about its form, and the old list
counted it as one because `HIPAA` was on the list. It is not a citation:
the step it sits in is cited by its own heading, `[HIPAA 164.316(b)(1) |
...]`, and the three scans that published it as the corpus's least
followable citation were counting a placeholder. The identifier rule is
what tells the two apart, and it is the only thing that does — backticks
do not, since a few real tags in generated documents are backticked too.
So the rule is: a name with nothing number-shaped after it is a phrase in
brackets, in generated content as much as in prose, and a reader who wants
it reported as something else should first go and read it in its document.

    `[NIST AI RMF Playbook Govern 1.1 Action 1 | Govern 1.1 Action 2]` is an
    ordinary shorthand, and glm wrote it in 17 of 17 Playbook sentences of
    one Standard. Split on `|` alone, the second part names no framework, so
    the Playbook gate never read those sentences and `satisfies` dropped the
    later parts (b5, #333).

    **80's ruling: inherit, with resolution required, through ONE function.**
    A part that does not begin with one of `frameworks` (matched longest
    first, at a word boundary, case-insensitive) inherits the framework of
    the nearest preceding part in the same tag. A first part with nothing to
    inherit keeps `framework=""`. **Inheriting never makes a citation
    valid**: every caller must resolve the inherited citation against that
    framework's catalog, so `[NIST 800-53 AC-2 | Govern 1.1 Action 2]` gives
    `NIST 800-53 Govern 1.1 Action 2`, which resolves nowhere and is
    reported, not silently read as 800-53.

    `names_framework(word)`, when given, says whether a part's first word is
    a framework the caller can resolve though it is not in `frameworks` --
    an abbreviation such as `ARC` for `ARC-AMPE`, which `satisfies` accepts.
    Such a part names its own framework and does not inherit.

    Both readers of a merged tag's parts call this: the Playbook gate
    (`content/deontic._parts`) and traceability (`topics/satisfies
    .parse_citations`), so both split and inherit by the same rule. **They
    pass different `frameworks`, so they can still attribute a part
    differently** (9b on #337): the gate knows only the Playbook's name, so
    in `[NIST AI RMF Playbook Govern 1.1 Action 1 | NIST AI RMF Govern 1 |
    Govern 1.1]` it reads the third part as the Playbook (it resolves there),
    while `satisfies` reads it as the AI RMF Core, the part it follows. No
    gate verdict depends on that today: such a tag is never Playbook-only,
    because it names a non-Playbook framework explicitly.
