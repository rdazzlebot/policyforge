"""Every graded prompt, with a fingerprint that changes when its text does.

MEASUREMENTS.md rests on one rule: *a number without an epoch is not
comparable with anything, which makes it worse than no number at all.* The
epoch is what says which prompts produced a result. Until now the epoch was
maintained by hand — somebody changed a prompt, and somebody remembered to
open a new epoch.

That failed the first time two people ran at once. A measured run against
`kimi-k3` was half finished when two commits landed that changed the edit
planner and the clusterer; the run had imported the old modules at process
start, so it was measuring code that no longer existed, and nothing in the
run or the report could have said so. It was caught by one person noticing
the timestamps. The number would otherwise have gone into the file looking
exactly like a number produced by current code.

A fingerprint removes the noticing. The hash is over the prompt *text*, not
over a version somebody declares, because the failure is never "I changed
the prompt and lied about the version" — it is "I changed the prompt and
forgot there was a version." Text is the thing that actually reached the
model, so text is the thing that gets hashed.

`version` is still here, and it is still written by hand, because the hash
answers "is this the same prompt" and cannot answer "is this a deliberate
change or a typo". The two are checked against each other: a text change
without a version bump is reported, since one of the two is wrong and the
report should not guess which.

Registering a prompt does not change how it is used. The constants stay
plain strings and every call site passes them exactly as before — a
registry that required rewriting eleven call sites to gain a hash would be
paid for in the currency it is trying to save.

**It does change how a prompt is found by a static check, and that has
already bitten once.** `SYSTEM_PROMPT = register(Prompt(...))` is an
`ast.Call`, where it used to be a bare `ast.Constant`. Anything that
locates prompts by matching the *shape* of the assignment — an AST walk
looking for a module-level string constant, a grep for `_PROMPT = "` —
walks straight past a registered prompt and reports success on the ones it
still finds. A credential-containment check written against the old shape
silently skipped `edit/plan.py`, `zardoz/answer.py` and
`entail/llm_entailer.py`: 14 constants found across 11 modules, with the
three most security-relevant prompts in the project missing and nothing
saying so.

The fix for such a check is to gather every string constant *underneath* the
assigned value rather than matching the assignment itself, which finds both
forms. Runtime access is unaffected — `getattr(module, "SYSTEM_PROMPT")`
still returns the `str`, which is why `scripts/mutate_zardoz.py` keeps
working unchanged, verified rather than assumed.
