"""Starting a PolicyForge project directory outside a clone of this repository.

Every command resolves its inputs relative to where it runs:
`config/config.yaml`, `config/topics.yaml`, `data/frameworks/*/controls.json`,
`output/`. From a clone those are all already there. From an installed
package — `pip install`, `pipx`, Homebrew — none of them are, and the first
command a new user runs fails looking for a catalog they were never given.

So the redistributable catalogs and the example configs ship inside the
package (`policyforge._bundled`, mapped from `data/frameworks/` and `config/`
in pyproject.toml rather than copied, so there is one source of truth), and
`policyforge init` lays them out as a project directory.

What ships is decided by licence, not by what happens to be on disk. The
package data in pyproject.toml names the bundled catalogs one by one: a glob
would package a licensed HITRUST export somebody had dropped into their own
checkout's `data/frameworks/`. `tests/test_scaffold.py` holds that list to
the catalogs whose manifests say `public-domain`.

Nothing here overwrites. A file that already exists is kept and reported, so
running `init` again — or in a clone — is safe, and a catalog someone has
re-fetched or a config they have edited is never replaced by the packaged one.
