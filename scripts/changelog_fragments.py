"""Assemble `changelog.d/` fragments into a release section of CHANGELOG.md.

WHY THIS EXISTS. One `## Unreleased` section means every pair of branches
shipping anything user-visible edits the same place in the same file, so
every pair conflicts. In a single sitting on 2026-09-18 that produced:

  - four hand-resolved conflicts in `Unreleased`
  - one resolution that silently converted 1,768 lines to CRLF, found by
    diffing a normalised copy rather than by running the formatter, which
    would have rewritten every line and hidden the one real change
  - one resolution that left an entry as a `###` heading, so five unrelated
    entries nested under "The HIPAA catalog verifies" — no conflict, no
    failing check, every merge individually correct, and only visible in the
    assembled text after the fifth merge
  - two user-visible merges that shipped with no entry at all

Every one of those is a property of *where the text lives*, not of anyone's
care. `scripts/changelog_guard.py` (#126) makes the last of them fail CI.
This removes the cause of the other three: a fragment is a new file, and new
files do not conflict.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, deliberately. It does not order the entries, group
them into categories, or invent headings. This changelog's voice is bold-lead
paragraphs in a deliberate narrative order — breaking changes first, the
reason before the remedy — and a tool that imposed `### Added` / `### Fixed`
would flatten that into something nobody here would have written. Assembly
emits fragments in filename order and the person cutting the release arranges
them, **once, in one file, with no conflict to resolve**. The value is
removing the conflict, not automating the judgement.

Usage:

    python scripts/changelog_fragments.py --check          # CI: are they well-formed
    python scripts/changelog_fragments.py --version 1.5.0  # cut the section
    python scripts/changelog_fragments.py --version 1.5.0 --dry-run

Writing one: a file in `changelog.d/` named after your branch, holding the
prose you would otherwise have put under `## Unreleased`. See
`changelog.d/README.md`.

#: sub-structure inside a fragment and must keep passing.

#: scan refused it.
_FENCE = re.compile(r"^\s*(?:```|~~~)")


_WHERE = r"(?:above|below)"

#: A pointer to another entry by where it sits (#387). Assembly orders
#: fragments by filename, author prefix first, so "see below" is a guess
#: about an order its writer cannot see from their own file: three were
#: written in one hour of 1.6.1's fixes, one per author, and every one
#: pointed the wrong way or was right by luck.
#:
#: **A pointer, not every "above" or "below".** Measured against the 3,691
#: lines of `CHANGELOG.md` at 1.6.1: the bare words matched 19 times. Ten
#: were pointers to other entries and nine were prose that must keep
#: passing ("would fall below the catalog", "mcp is held below 2", "the
#: requirement above it", "the note above the rows");
#: `tests/test_changelog_fragments.py` holds all nine, so a later widening
#: that reintroduces one fails.
#:
#: **Of the ten pointers, eight are matched here, one is skipped on
#: purpose, and one is missed** (1d and policyforge-b5 on #420).
#:
#: - Matched: "see below" (with an adverb: "see further below"), a noun
#:   naming an entry beside a position ("the entry above", "the harness
#:   change below", "the ledger fix above"), a quoted entry title followed
#:   by one, "the above" standing alone, and "everything else below".
#: - Skipped: `<- see below` inside a fenced table (1.6.0). A fence is an
#:   example, not prose, by the same rule as the heading check.
#: - **Missed: a pointer whose subject is any other noun**: "the Part 2
#:   catalog above" (1.5.0), "the ledger bug above". That vocabulary is
#:   open, and a noun list would never finish, so for that shape review is
#:   still the instrument. The test file holds the real one as a strict
#:   expected miss, red the day this starts to catch it.
#:
#: **Also unmatched, deliberately: time words.** "see earlier in these
#: notes", "the preceding fix", "the following change", "a later fix".
#: Only "previous/next/preceding/following entry" is refused. In
#: `CHANGELOG.md` the family occurs twice and both are prose ("a later fix
#: would need", "the first fix still let"), so refusing it would cry wolf
#: at the measured rate.
#:
#: **A comparison is not a pointer.** A noun then a position then a
#: complement ("a change below 5%", "a fix below 1.0", "below the
#: catalog") compares; a pointer has nothing after the position. "You see
#: below" describes rather than directs, and passes. `section` is not in the
#: noun list: a fragment may use `###`, so "the section below" is within it.
