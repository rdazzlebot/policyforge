# Subprocessors and data flow

Every party that can receive your content when you run PolicyForge, and what
you must confirm about each one yourself.

## Read this first

**PolicyForge has no subprocessors of its own.** It is software you run; the
maintainers operate no service, receive no data, and cannot see anything you
generate. There is no account, no license server, and no telemetry — a
commitment enforced by
[`tests/test_no_undeclared_endpoints.py`](../tests/test_no_undeclared_endpoints.py),
listed as [C-01](commitments.md#c-01--nothing-is-contacted-that-the-operator-did-not-configure).

What follows is therefore not a list of *our* subprocessors. It is a list of
**the parties you may choose to introduce**, so that your vendor register and
your data-flow diagram can be accurate. Every one of them is something you
configured.

**We cannot attest to any third party's terms.** Retention periods, training
use, sub-processing, and BAA availability are between you and them, and they
change. The "you must confirm" column is the actual deliverable of this page.

## Model providers

Exactly one is active at a time, named by `llm.provider` in your config.

| `provider`      | Who receives content                                                    | Class                       | You must confirm                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anthropic`     | Anthropic                                                               | third-party                 | Retention, training use, whether a BAA is available and executed                                                                                                                                      |

| `vertex`        | Google Cloud (your project)                                             | third-party                 | Your GCP agreement and BAA; Vertex terms for the specific model                                                                                                                                       |
| `litellm`       | Whatever LiteLLM routes to, which may itself route to further providers | third-party                 | **Two hops.** OpenRouter's terms *and* the terms of whichever upstream serves your model. This is the least transparent option                                                                        |
| `openai-compat` | Whatever endpoint you set in `base_url`                                 | inferred from the URL       | Where that endpoint actually runs, and who operates it                                                                                                                                                |
| `local`         | Nothing leaves the host                                                 | local                       | Nothing                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `cascade`       | Both halves of the cascade                                              | the more exposed of the two | Both, on the terms above                                                                                                                                                                              |

A note on `litellm`/OpenRouter, because it is the configuration most people
start with and the one with the longest chain: content may traverse two
organizations before reaching a model, and a route can change without your
config changing. If your content classification matters, this is the
provider to scrutinize first.

The embedder and reranker are called out because they are the two channels
that would otherwise carry your policy corpus somewhere unclassified and
unrecorded. [`llm/channel.py`](../src/policyforge/llm/channel.py) exists
specifically to hold them to the same ceiling as a model, and
[`tests/test_side_channels.py`](../tests/test_side_channels.py) asserts text a
ceiling forbids never reaches the endpoint.

## The MCP server introduces no recipient, but a new trigger

Worth separating, because the two get conflated. The MCP server
(`policyforge mcp`) exposes seven read-only tools to an external agent. It
**adds no party to this page**: nothing in it fetches, every tool reads the
corpus and catalogs already on disk, and the transport is stdio — a local
subprocess, no port, no remote connection.

One of those tools, `ask_documents`, answers from the corpus, and if a model
is configured it calls that model to write the grounded answer. Same
provider, same ledger, same boundary check as the CLI. So:

- **No new recipient.** Your content goes nowhere it was not already going.
- **A new trigger.** A model call can now originate from an agent rather
  than from a person typing a command.

If your vendor register records *when* a processor is invoked rather than
only *which* processors exist, that distinction belongs in it.
`policyforge model-log` shows the calls either way.

## What actually gets sent

Worth stating plainly, because "sends your data to an AI provider" is both
true and uselessly vague:

| Sent                                           | Not sent                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Control catalog text for the controls in scope | Your credentials ([C-02](commitments.md#c-02--no-credential-ever-reaches-a-model)) |
| Your company context, if you supplied it       | Anything from `output/` unless it is the document being edited                     |
| The topic and document being drafted           | The model ledger                                                                   |
| For edits: the live page being rewritten       | Version history                                                                    |
| For Zardoz: the retrieved passages             | Files outside the working tree                                                     |

Licensed catalog content (HITRUST, GovRAMP) is **not** sent to a third party
unless you raise its ceiling, which requires an explicit config change.

## Keeping content in your boundary

Two supported configurations, in increasing order of restriction:

```yaml
# Everything of your own stays on your network; public catalogs may go out.
llm:
  boundary:
    organization-internal: self-hosted
```

```yaml
# Nothing leaves the host at all. Requires a local model.
llm:
  provider: local
  base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1
  boundary:
    public-domain: local
    organization-internal: local
```

Verify either with **`policyforge boundary`** before running anything, and
audit what actually happened with **`policyforge model-log`**. Those two
commands are how you evidence this section to an assessor rather than citing
this page.

## For your vendor register

Copy-paste starting point. Delete the rows you do not use.

> **PolicyForge** (Apache-2.0, self-hosted CLI). No vendor relationship; no
> data received by the maintainers; no telemetry. Introduces the following
> processors, each configured by us: *[model provider]* for document
> drafting; *[Atlassian instance]* for publication. Content classes sent:
> public-domain catalog text and organization-internal drafting context.
> Licensed catalog content is restricted to a local model by default.
> Evidence: `policyforge boundary`, `policyforge model-log`.
