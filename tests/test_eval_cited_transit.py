"""A cited block may not say "in transit" where its own citations never do (#174).

`_tags` asks whether a reference is one the synthesis carries, never whether
the sentence under it came from that reference. The instances here are real,
from epoch 21's glm run (2026-09-17), and each passed every existing check:

- "encrypt ePHI at rest and in transit" under HIPAA 164.312(a)(2)(iv), whose
  text is "a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt electronic protected health
  information";
- "encryption in transit" under ARC-AMPE SC-28, which is protection of
  information AT REST.

The check is narrow on purpose, and sized before it was written: across that
run's 60 documents (1,096 cited blocks) "in transit" fired 3 times, all real.
"At rest" fired 4 times, mostly on defensible glosses, and is left out.
