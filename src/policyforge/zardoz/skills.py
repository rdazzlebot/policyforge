"""The analyses Zardoz can run, as distinct from the documents it can read.

Until now Zardoz's whole world was the synced corpus: ask it something, it
finds passages and answers from them. But half the questions people have
about a compliance programme are not answerable from any document, because
they are questions *about* the programme rather than about its prose. Which
controls does nobody own. What did the catalog change last month. How many
organization-defined values are still undecided. Nothing in a Standard says
any of that; it falls out of set arithmetic over the registry, the catalogs
and the ledger.

Those computations already exist as CLI commands. What was missing was a way
to reach them from the place people are actually asking the question.

**The model routes; the report speaks.** A skill is chosen by the model —
that is a judgement about intent, which is what models are for — and then
its output is printed *verbatim*. The model never reads a result and tells
you about it. That division is the whole safety property here: a paraphrase
of "14 orphaned controls" can become "mostly in the audit family" with
nothing to check it against, and a compliance answer nobody can check is
worth less than no answer. Routing can be wrong in a way you can see, since
the chosen skill is always named. Reporting cannot be wrong at all, because
no model touches it.

Every skill is read-only. That is not a convention here — the package-wide
import guard makes the Confluence publish path unreachable from any module
in this directory, and a test walks the AST to prove it. A skill that wanted
to publish could not be written in this file.

    """Why each framework reachable through the crosswalk covers nothing.

    **A zero under a heading that reads as a gap is not a finding until it
    carries its cause.** A zero means one of several things, and which ones
    a user sees depends on their topics and overlays as much as on the
    catalogs:

    - `Information Blocking` is refused **by design**. Its entries are
      conditions of an exception, not controls to implement, so mapping
      them would assert something neither document says. That zero is the
      correct answer and `NOT_CROSSWALK_ANCHORABLE` already holds the
      reason as prose.
    - `42 CFR Part 2` seeds a crosswalk normally, and no published mapping
      was found (#264). That zero is work nobody has done -- as far as a
      search that did not enumerate NIST OLIR can say -- and
      `SEARCHED_NONE_FOUND` holds the search record.
    - **A source that publishes a mapping PolicyForge does not yet read**:
      that zero is a gap in PolicyForge, not in the source, and
      `PUBLISHED_UPSTREAM` holds the reason. `NIST 800-171` was the case
      until #259 -- NIST's own OSCAL links all 97 requirements to 800-53 --
      and it now carries that mapping, so it is a crosswalk-carrying
      catalog below. The table is empty today.
    - **A catalog that carries a crosswalk** -- HIPAA, FedRAMP, ARC-AMPE
      -- reads zero for up to three reasons AT ONCE, one per requirement,
      so its row is one counted clause per reason and the counts sum to
      the catalog's whole requirement count (80's ruling on #270):
      *partial* -- the topics own the control, but the organisation's
      overlay records the mapping as `superset`/`intersects`, so whether
      that is enough is a person's call; *unowned* -- mapped to a control
      no topic owns, so the gap is in the topics and a hand-seeded pair
      would compete with the publisher's; *unmapped* -- no mapping in this
      catalog's crosswalk at all (HIPAA's 164.306(a)-(e) among 9), with no
      advice. One sentence spoke for this mixed population three times on
      #270 before it was split. `covered` is the catalog joined to the
      user's topics and overlay, not a fact about the file: the example
      registry anchors so much that none of this showed (1d, on #270).
    - **Any other catalog** -- every BYOC one, and any shipped one added
      later without a crosswalk -- is in none of those tables and carries no
      mapping. Its row states only that. Until #264 this branch printed "no
      published crosswalk yet" for all of them, including the two above,
      which is a claim about the world that no one had checked.

    **This docstring said the opposite until #260**: *"`42 CFR Part 2` and
    `NIST 800-171` seed a crosswalk normally. Nobody has published one."*
    The report then told 800-171 users to rebuild by hand, with `crosswalk
    seed`, a mapping NIST publishes in the very file the catalog is built
    from. The two-way framing — *leave it alone* against *go and map it* —
    had no place for a zero the source had already answered, so the third
    kind was filed under the second.

    Those want different responses — *leave it alone*, *wait for the
    ingest*, *fix the topics*, *decide whether partial is enough*, *go and
    map it*, and *find out, then map it* — and the report prints the same
    number for all of them. The header names no count: it went from two
    kinds to six in a day, and a count in output is a claim that goes stale
    in a place nobody adding a kind thinks to look (80, on #270). The rows
    carry the taxonomy. The reasons are looked up from the declared
    framework name, which is reliable since the two CFR catalogs were
    renamed to be citable.

    **`catalog_paths` is what makes the remedy performable.** Without it
    this printed `crosswalk seed --framework 'NIST 800-171'`, which the
    shell can run because `discover()` loaded nine catalogs, and which
    exits 1 from the CLI's own default context because that context holds
    two. policyforge-80 got exit 1 and policyforge-9b got a clean run from
    the same printed line — **the disagreement between two runs was the
    finding**, and neither run was wrong. A command that works only in the
    context that printed it is a remedy in the same sense that a check
    which cannot fail is a check.

    So the flags are emitted, and they name the catalog that declared the
    framework plus the 800-53 anchor a crosswalk is built against. Both,
    because seeding needs the thing being mapped and the thing it maps to.

    invented `baseline: moderate` on one question of ten and
    `deepseek-v4-flash` on three — always "moderate", always for a question
    that named no baseline at all. A prompt is a request and a check is a

    Routing has always had this fallback and this had not, and the gap was
    measured rather than guessed. `glm-5.3-flash` through OpenRouter sometimes
    ignores the schema's wrapper and replies with the bare word — `frameworks`
    rather than `{"also": "frameworks"}`. The provider rightly refuses a reply
    that is not the JSON it promised, and without a fallback that correct
    answer became `none`: chaining went from 11/11 to 8/11 on one run while
    routing, which recovers exactly this way, held at 54/54.

    That bare word is read straight from the refused reply (`SchemaReplyError`
    carries it), so this call is made only when the reply was neither JSON nor
    a word from the list. The first version asked again on any failure, which
    re-asked for an answer already in hand and turned a timeout into two
    (found by policyforge-ba).

    The word is still checked against the closed list by the caller, so this
    cannot invent an analysis — only recover one the model already chose.
