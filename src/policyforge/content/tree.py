"""Reading a directory of markdown documents into something addressable.

A document on disk is a file; a document in a governance program is a thing
with a tier, an owner and a published location. This module is the mapping
between the two, and it is deliberately tolerant about how much of that a
file actually declares.

Frontmatter is the explicit form:

    ---
    title: Access Control Standard
    tier: standard
    topic: Access Control
    owner: Security Engineering
    confluence:
      space: ENG
      title: Access Control Standard
    ---

Nothing requires it. A file with no frontmatter still resolves: the tier
comes from the directory it sits in (`standards/` -> standard, the layout
`policyforge generate` already writes), the slug from the filename, and the
title from the first H1. That matters because the documents this project has
already generated carry no frontmatter at all, and a content model that only
works for files written after it existed is a migration nobody performs.

Where both are present, frontmatter wins. It is the only place a document
can say something the filesystem cannot express — which published page it
corresponds to, most importantly, since a repo path and a Confluence title
are not the same string and pretending otherwise is how a publish lands on
the wrong page.
