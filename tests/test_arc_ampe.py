"""ARC-AMPE Volume II, and finding the catalog inside an SSPP template.

The workbooks built here are invented, but their awkward shape is copied
from CMS's: a controls sheet that opens with a title, an instruction
paragraph and a twenty-row family index before its header; a separate
`Instructional Guidance` sheet that reproduces that same header over a
three-row worked example; six pairs of blank implementation columns to the
right of the data; and a guidance cell that says, in words, that there is no
guidance.

That last pair is the point of most of these tests. Captions alone pick the
wrong sheet — the decoy matches every one of them, and matches earlier in
the workbook — which is a failure that produces a plausible three-control
catalog rather than an error.

    Three things were true before this test and only two were checked:
    the catalog guard proves no sentinel *survived*, and the loader tests
    prove `_guidance` is right on hand-written strings. **Nothing proved
    no real guidance was emptied** — and that is the direction this
    change moves, and the direction whose failure is silent, because a
    document simply renders without the obligation.

    Designed by policyforge-b5 in review, after I offered a worse
    version that fetched CMS's workbook over the network: that would be
    muted the first week the URL moved, which is the failure
    `test_info_blocking_loader.py`'s docstring warns about. Cells, not
    the workbook. No network, no URL to rot.

    The fixture is real cells lifted from CMS's published v1.02: every
    sentinel cell, plus genuine guidance taken on a fixed stride rather
    than hand-picked — choosing the interesting ones is how the original
    defect survived review in the first place. The stride caught one
    that matters more than anything I would have chosen: a cell opening
    "Note: Ensure that all three bullets of this Supplemental Control
    Requirements & Guidance are reviewed", which mentions the sentinel's
    words and is binding guidance.

    **What this catches, measured rather than intended.** Mutating the
    pattern back to the original `requirements and guidance` takes the
    count from 96 to 77 and fails here — that is this test's unique
    contribution, and no other test in this file catches it.

    **What it does not catch, stated because the name suggests
    otherwise.** It does not independently guard the destructive
    direction. Broadening the pattern (`any` for `all`, prefix
    anchoring, a wider trailing slot) leaves every cell here untouched,
    because no genuine cell in CMS's corpus sits close enough to the
    sentinel to be swallowed — the "Note:" cell is the nearest and does
    not open with "there are no". Those mutants are caught by the
    hand-written one-sentence tests above, and **real data cannot
    replace them**: a corpus only exercises the failures it happens to
    contain.

    One mutant survives this whole file: widening the negation so
    `there are <any word> supplemental…` matches. Nothing in v1.02
    distinguishes it, so it is unobservable here rather than untested.
