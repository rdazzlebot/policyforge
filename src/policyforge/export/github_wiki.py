"""A GitHub wiki as a publish target: a git repository of markdown pages.

A wiki is `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.wiki.git`, one file per page,
named by title with spaces as hyphens (`Access-Review-Standard.md`). It has
no storage format and no version number, so the three guards in
`publisher.py` are answered from git: a commit sha where Confluence has a
version, a commit trailer where it has a version message, the file itself
where it has storage markup.

Two differences from the Confluence adapter are deliberate.

**Bytes are the comparison.** Confluence may reflow a page when it saves,
so its adapter compares storage format with the whitespace between tags
collapsed. A git-backed wiki changes nothing on its own: every byte that
differs, differs because somebody changed it. So `same_content` compares
the rendered body to the file, newline folding aside, and any difference is
an edit — the direction to be wrong in for a guard whose job is refusing to
overwrite work nobody has seen.

**Nothing is read from anywhere but the clone.** The working clone lives
under `output/.wiki/<owner>-<repo>/`, gitignored, fetched before every
operation. A page is never read from the API, so what the guard compares
and what the write pushes are the same bytes on the same disk.

Git runs by argv, never through a shell, as `edit/tree.py` and
`frameworks/drift.py` do. Credentials reach it through the environment and
never touch a command line or `.git/config` — see `_wiki_auth.py`.

    Two places say so: the document's own frontmatter, and the provenance

    **An unrecognised class counts as not licensed, and that is deliberate.**
    It is the opposite direction from unknown visibility a few lines above,

    to be discovered and "corrected" in whichever direction the next reader
    guesses. Unknown visibility is a question this tool asked and failed to

    Content class is an open field on a document anybody may hand-write, and
    most documents in most trees carry none at all: failing closed on it
    would refuse every unstamped document on every public wiki, which makes
    the feature unusable and gets the check disabled rather than obeyed. So
    the ceiling holds where the class is *said*, and `generate` says it on
    everything it writes — all 59 documents of the measured corpus carry
    `generated_by.content_class`. Where nothing says it, the wiki's
    visibility rule is what stands between the document and the world.

    Values are stripped before comparison because frontmatter is
