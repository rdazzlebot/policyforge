"""42 CFR Part 2 — confidentiality of substance use disorder patient records.

**Two of this part's thirty-eight sections are controls. That is the whole
catalog, and the thinness is the correct answer rather than a parse
failure** — which is why the README states the count, states the test, and
names what was rejected.

**Part 2 is mostly conduct, not controls**, and that is the same trap 45 CFR
171 set. 800-53 says what to implement. Most of Part 2 says when a
disclosure is permitted, what a consent must contain, and what a court must
find before it orders a record produced. Citing § 2.66 asserts that a court
*may* authorise a disclosure; it does not assert that a control exists. A
catalog that crosswalked these to 800-53 by resemblance would be wrong in
the direction that is hardest to see, because every entry would look
plausible.

**One section is genuinely about security, and it was verified against the
fetched text rather than remembered.** § 2.16, "Security for records and
notification of breaches", requires formal policies and procedures covering
transfer and removal of paper records, destruction including sanitizing
hard-copy media to non-retrievable, secure rooms and locked containers,
workstation access, and de-identification to 45 CFR 164.514(b) — then the
same list for electronic records — and imports 45 CFR part 160 and subpart
D of part 164 for breach notification.

**§ 2.16 is a hub, and the test that sorts its references from its peers
is the reason this catalog has two entries rather than one or four:**

    Does this section impose an obligation that would not exist without it?
    If yes, it is a control. If it only says *apply § 2.16 to this
    population*, it is a requirement of § 2.16.

Applied mechanically rather than by judgement — an obligation is
independent if the section is the only place in the part where the
machinery appears, which is a set difference against § 2.16's own text that
anyone can re-run:

    2.19   CONTROL     13 terms absent from § 2.16 — encryption at rest,
                       separated decryption tools, backup on separate media,
                       labelled sealed containers, climate control, a
                       one-year sanitization deadline, retention periods
    2.52   derivative  0 terms unique to it; 2 references to § 2.16
    2.53   derivative  0 terms unique to it; 2 references to § 2.16

§ 2.19 is the one to notice, and *how* it hides is worth keeping. Its
heading says "Disposition of records by discontinued programs", and its
(a) *General* paragraph really is derivative — § 2.16's policies applied at
shutdown. **(b) *Special procedure* is a different regime entirely, and
that is where the controls live.** A reader asking "is this derivative?"
gets a correct yes from the paragraph that answers it and never reaches the
one that does not. The general/special split is a property of how
regulations are written, so the test is applied to a section's **full
text** and never to a quoted clause.

**Nothing emitted is empty, at any level.** A `[Reserved]` paragraph inside
a control that is being emitted is omitted from its requirements and its
absence asserted by id. Part 2 has **no** reserved sections and three
reserved paragraphs — § 2.19(b)(1)(i)(B), § 2.63(b), § 2.68(b) — so the
rule written for sections has nothing to bite on here and the paragraph
case is the only case. It is also the worse one: an empty entry sitting
alone in a catalog is conspicuous, while one hiding among real requirements
inherits that control's credibility. § 2.68(b) was reserved by the 2024
rule itself, so these are deliberate current drafting rather than stale
debris.

**Fetching is `ingest/ecfr.py`**, shared with every regulation this project
reads, and it already covers this part: `tests/test_ecfr_fetch.py` pins
`(42, "2", "title-42.xml?part=2")`. The wrappers below name Part 2's own
coordinates, because "which title and part is the confidentiality rule" is
a property of the regulation rather than a choice an ETL command makes.

FRAMEWORK_VERSION = "42 CFR Part 2"

#: A section identifier as *this part* numbers them, derived from the part
#: rather than adapted from a neighbour. Part 2 runs `2.1` to `2.68`: one or
#: two digits after the dot, never three.
#:
#: Stated as a measurement because the near miss is silent. Part 171's
#: pattern is `^171\.\d{3,4}$`, and against Part 2's 38 real section numbers
#: it matches **zero** — so a catalog built on a copied pattern comes out
#: empty, with nothing raising and every downstream check passing on the
#: nothing. `_require_sections` exists so that failure is loud.
SECTION_ID_RE = re.compile(r"^2\.\d{1,2}$")

#: How many sections Part 2 had at the 2026-09-17 revision. **A pinned
#: observation, not an invariant** — the CFR gains and loses sections, and
#: the day this number is wrong is a day someone should read the part
#: rather than a day the parser is broken.
#:
#: It is the *weaker* of the two count checks and it is second on purpose.
#: A hand-written expected count is something nobody can re-derive, so
#: `_require_sections` asks the document how many sections it has before it
#: consults this number at all — see there. This one exists for the failure
#: the document cannot self-report: a truncated or wrong response, where
#: the XML is internally consistent and simply is not the whole part.
EXPECTED_SECTIONS = 38

#: Sections that carry a number and a title and no obligation. Dropped for
#: the reason `hipaa_loader` drops them — a defined term is not a
#: requirement — and *asserted absent* rather than listed as exceptions,
#: because an exception list has to be kept in step with the source while an
#: assertion of absence cannot drift.

    r"\[reserved\]|^definitions|^statutory authority|^purpose and effect",

#: The sections that impose a security obligation of their own, by the test
#: in the module docstring. **Enumerated rather than detected**, and that is
#: the deliberate choice: a heuristic that decided this at parse time would
#: quietly add a control the day a section's wording drifted, and adding a
#: control to a compliance catalog is not something that should happen
#: without a person.
#:
#: Two guards hold it, and they cover different things:
#: `test_the_catalog_still_matches_the_test_that_produced_it` sweeps every
#: parsed section and fails if the qualifying set stops equalling this one
#: -- so a section here ceasing to qualify, or one not here starting to, is
#: caught. `_require_sections` fails when the part carries a different
#: number of sections than `EXPECTED_SECTIONS` records, which is what
#: catches a *new* section arriving and forces someone to decide whether it
#: belongs here.
#:
#: Neither is a claim that this list cannot go stale. A revision that
#: rewords a section without changing the section count, in a way the
#: machinery terms do not reach, would pass both. The terms are a search,
#: not a definition -- see the README on § 2.66, where the one term the
#: sweep finds is a judicial seal rather than a container.
CONTROL_SECTIONS = ("2.16", "2.19")

#: A paragraph marker opening a top-level requirement: `(a)`, `(b)`. Digits
#: and roman numerals are deeper nesting and stay inside the requirement
#: they qualify, which is the split `info_blocking` makes and `hipaa_loader`
#: makes before it.
_LETTERED_RE = re.compile(r"^\(([a-z])\)\s*(.*)$", re.DOTALL)

#: `(1)` opening a paragraph — one level below a lettered requirement.
_DIGIT_RE = re.compile(r"^\(\d+\)")

#: Single letters that are also roman numerals. eCFR's XML gives no
#: structural hint — `(a)`, `(1)` and `(i)` are flat sibling `<P>` elements
#: at every depth — so `(i)` is ambiguous between the ninth letter and roman
#: one. `info_blocking._opens_condition` carries the full analysis of why
#: only `i`, `v` and `x` belong here and why `c`, `d`, `l` and `m` must not.
#:
#: **Measured on this part rather than inherited**: reading any single
#: letter as a requirement gave § 2.16 a phantom `2.16(i)` that stole the
#: paper-records list out of `2.16(a)`, and gave § 2.19 **two requirements
#: both numbered `2.19(i)`** plus a `2.19(v)`. Duplicate ids in a compliance
#: catalog are the silent kind of wrong: every entry is well-formed, the
#: count looks plausible, and two different obligations answer to one
#: citation.
_ROMAN_LETTERS = frozenset("ivx")

#: A paragraph whose whole body is `[Reserved]`. Matched at any depth,
#: because in this part every reserved paragraph is deep: the one inside a
#: control is `2.19(b)(1)(i)(B)`, four levels down, where it would otherwise
#: be folded into a requirement's prose rather than appearing as an entry.
#: That is the form 80's ruling is about — an empty statement inheriting the
