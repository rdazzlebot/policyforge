"""A list item starts a new block; a colon lead-in keeps its items (#351).

`analyze` joined a sentence ending in a full stop to the list item under it,
so an uncited obligation borrowed the item's citation and "binds but cites
nothing" went silent on it. The cause is the sentence boundary rule
(`entail/base._BOUNDARY_RE`): a stop ends a sentence only before a capital,
a quote, `[` or `(`, so a list marker never begins one, blank line or not.

80's ruling: a list item starts a new block, as in CommonMark, and a
sentence ending in `.` takes no citation from the item after it. **A colon
lead-in is different** -- `The owner must identify:` is carried by its items
-- and must still read as one statement with them.

The 33 generated Standards contain no instance of the joined shape once
#349's heading boundary is in (their citations sit on the line below, which
already splits), so these hand-written cases are what carry the fix.
