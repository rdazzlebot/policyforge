"""Whether a quote a model gave is really in the text it quoted.

A proposed mapping carries two quotes — the words of the requirement it
addresses and the words of the control that address them — and a mapping
whose quotes are not in the texts is refused before anybody reviews it. The
quotes are what a reviewer reads instead of both documents, so a quote the
text does not contain would put a fabricated reason in front of the person
deciding.

Exact substring matching was the first version, and measured on 75 HIPAA
requirements it refused 73 mappings, most of them right. SP 800-53 writes
its parameters as `[Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity]`,
and a model quoting that control writes "protect the confidentiality and
integrity", which is the text read aloud rather than a fabrication. Models
also join two clauses with an ellipsis. So matching is over words, in
order: bracketed parameter syntax is set aside, a few missing or inserted
words are tolerated, and an ellipsis splits a quote into fragments that must
each be found, in order. What stays refused is what matters — words the text
does not contain, or its words out of order.
