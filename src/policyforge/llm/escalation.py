"""No silent escalation: every bigger-budget re-send is announced and recorded (#361).

A reasoning model can spend its whole output budget thinking and return an
empty reply, which is still billed. The providers recover by re-sending at
8x the budget (`_inline_thinking.retry_budget`, `_anthropic_compat`), and
`effort` retries a cut-off reply at 2x. Measured on #301: sonnet's
Evaluation Standard came back empty at 16,384 tokens ($0.1985), and the 8x
re-send's worst case was $1.4109. **Nothing told the user either had
happened**, and the ledger kept only the second attempt's request id (#343).

80's ruling (#361, half 1): the user is told before the re-send goes out,
naming the topic, the model, the new `max_tokens` and the worst-case cost at
that model's list price, and the billed first attempt is recorded in the
ledger. Half 2, sizing the first budget, waits for a user-approved
measurement and is not done here.

**How it reaches the ledger without double counting.** `announce` keeps each
escalation for the current call; `RecordingProvider` takes them into the
call's one row (`CallRecord.escalations`). That row's cost is already the
summed cost where the provider reports one (LiteLLM), so a separate row for
the first attempt would count it twice. A call that fails keeps the same
shape (#343): every billed request's cost is in its row's total and its id
is on the row or in `escalations`. One row per request was considered and
dropped (80 on #343), because that conservation is what it was for.

**`first_cost_usd` is never added to a ledger total** (#372, measured with
fakes billing known amounts; #343 closed the error-row exception):

- **On a row that has a cost.** On LiteLLM's 8x path the row's `cost_usd`
  already sums both attempts. On `effort`'s 2x path the first attempt is
  its own row, and the escalation on the second row repeats it. The sum of
  row costs equals what was billed on both paths.
- **On an error row too.** When the re-send fails, the exception carries
  what both attempts billed, so the row's `cost_usd` is the sum: $0.20 +
  $1.30 billed, $1.50 in the row, and the $0.20 here is already in it. A
  provider that reports no cost leaves the row's cost None, as on success.

**Scoped to `ledger.about`.** Each `about` block starts a fresh pending list
and closes it on exit, so an escalation from a call that recorded no row
(an unwrapped provider) cannot land in a later, unrelated row. One still
pending at exit is not dropped silently: `end` names its billed first
attempt on stderr (80 on #373). Outside any `about` block there is one
list, and the next recorded call takes it.
