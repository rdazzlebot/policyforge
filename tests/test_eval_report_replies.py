"""The eval report says, per run, why each reply stopped and how long it was.

The truncation re-measure had one `length` stop in 200 calls and no way to
tell whether it was the run that failed: the harness recorded pass or fail
and the ledger recorded stop reasons, and nothing joined them. Now the meter
keeps every reply's stop reason and output tokens, `run_case` attaches this
run's slice to its outcome, and the report prints them on a failure and
counts the runs that had a cut-off reply.
