"""Runs a cheap model and falls back to a stronger one when the cheap model
demonstrably could not do the job.

The measurement this is built on: `deepseek-v4-flash` scores 92% routing,
100% resolution, 100% expansion at $0.0013 a sweep; `deepseek-v4-pro`
scores 97/100/100 at $0.0607, forty-seven times the price for one extra
routing case. Paying Pro rates for every call to cover the rare one is the
wrong trade, and so is never having Pro available.

**What counts as "could not do the job" is narrow on purpose.** Only
`ReasoningBudgetExhausted` escalates by default: the model spent its whole
budget deliberating, twice, and never began an answer. That is a fact the
provider layer can see for itself, unambiguously, without knowing anything
about the task.

Everything more interesting than that — a wrong routing decision, an answer
citing a passage it should not, an unfilled placeholder reproduced as fact
— is invisible here, and deliberately so. `LLMProvider.generate()` receives
a system prompt, a user prompt and a budget; it never sees the passages,
so it cannot run `zardoz/answer.py`'s integrity checks. A cascade gated on
*those* belongs in `answer_question`, which holds the question, the
passages, the provider and the verdict at once. It is a separate piece of
work and is on the roadmap. This one is the floor, not the ceiling.

Nothing is hidden. The `LLMResponse.model` of an escalated call names the
model that actually answered, so a caller can always tell which one it got.

    #
    # The rule, stated once because "the cascade supports X" is ambiguous
    # when the halves differ: **the cascade advertises a capability only
    # when both halves do.** Which half answers a given request is decided
    # by a runtime failure, after the request was built, so a caller that
    # was promised a capability has to get it from whichever half answers.
    # For a shape-changing capability (schema, grounding) the alternative is
    # a JSON reply most of the time and prose the rest, or verified citation
    # spans until the day an escalation returns bare markers. For a request
    # hint (effort, caching) the alternative is a `TypeError` from a half
    # whose `generate` does not take the argument, or a hint silently dropped
    # on escalation. Both are the kind of difference nobody notices until it
    # matters, which is what the flags exist to prevent.
    #
    # The cost of the rule is that a local + hosted cascade advertises the
    # local half's capabilities, and a user who wants effort or citations on
    # the hosted half configures it directly. `policyforge llm-check` prints
    # the table for the cascade as configured, so that trade is visible.
    #
    # Until this was written, only `supports_schema` was forwarded and the
    # other four fell to the base class's False — so a flash -> pro cascade
    # of two capable models sent no effort, marked no cache prefix and asked
    # for no citations, the same class of silent loss as the ledger wrapper
    # bug that cost a release. `tests/test_cascade_provider.py` now discovers
