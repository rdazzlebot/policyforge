"""Turns a synthesized topic (see synthesis/merge.py) plus org context
(industry, vendor stack, existing docs) into a drafted document at one of
three tiers, matching this project's document hierarchy:

    Policy > Standard > Procedure

- **Standard** (`generate_standard`) is the detailed, technical tier:
  every synthesized requirement, source-tagged back to the frameworks it
  came from, vendor-specific where the org context allows it. Audience:
  security/IT staff who implement and audit against it.
- **Policy** (`generate_policy`) is the brief, principle-level tier read by
  the whole organization, not just practitioners. It compresses the same
  synthesized requirements into a small number of plain-language
  commitments, drops framework/control citations entirely (that
  traceability lives in the Standard), and points to the Standard by name
  for anyone who needs the specifics.
- **Procedure** (`generate_procedure`) is one level *more* granular than the
  Standard tier: it turns each requirement into the literal ordered steps a
  practitioner performs to satisfy it, still source-tagged for traceability.
  Audience: the same security/IT staff as the Standard, but read while
  actually doing the task rather than while auditing against it.

Output contract: every generator here must return portable, well-formed
CommonMark markdown — no Obsidian wikilinks, no vault-relative-only paths.
This is the *canonical* output; export/confluence_exporter.py converts this
same markdown to Confluence storage format rather than generating
Confluence content independently. See README's "Output format priority"
section — getting this contract right is what keeps both output formats
correct.

Documents get `[Square-Bracket Placeholder]` placeholders wherever a detail
isn't available from the organization context below (a vendor, an owning
team, an exceptions contact) rather than inventing a specific name.

Turn a set of already-synthesized, source-tagged requirement statements \
into a formal information security STANDARD document for one \
organization.

Rules:
- Output portable, well-formed CommonMark markdown only: a single '#'
  document title, '##' sections, no Obsidian-style [[wikilinks]], no
  vault-relative-only paths, properly closed code fences, well-formed
  tables. This markdown must render correctly unmodified on GitHub, in a
  plain text editor, or pasted into Confluence.
- Every requirement in the input must be reflected in the output — do not
  drop or water down a requirement, and do not add requirements that
  weren't in the input.
- Preserve each requirement's inline source tag (e.g. `[NIST 800-53 IA-5 |
  GovRAMP IA-5]`) so the document stays traceable back to the frameworks it
  was drawn from.
- A requirement tagged `[NIST AI RMF Playbook ...]` is NIST's voluntary
  suggestion, not a requirement. Write it as NIST suggesting the action
  ("NIST suggests ..."), keep its tag, and never give that sentence "must",
  "shall", "is required to" or any other obligation: this overrides the
  formal-language rule for these sentences only. If the organization adopts
  the action as its own requirement, say so in a SEPARATE sentence that does
  not carry the Playbook tag. NEVER put a Playbook tag on a heading, not even
  merged with another framework's tag: this overrides any rule that places
  tags on headings. Put it only on the "NIST suggests ..." sentence inside
  the section.
- If the input has a "NIST AI RMF Playbook" block, write exactly ONE
  sentence per subcategory in it, framed as NIST suggesting: \
"{PLAYBOOK_SENTENCE_FORM}" \
with N the count the block
  gives. Restate only what the actions you cite say, and cite every action
  you draw on with its tag (several may share one tag, separated by "|").
  No Playbook action becomes a requirement of the organization.
- Where a requirement is vendor/tool-specific: if the tool list below fills
  that role, use that tool's actual name. If not, write the role itself in
  square brackets (`[Identity Provider]`, `[Ticketing System]`, `[Backup
  System]`) rather than naming a product the organization has not said it
  uses. Write the role exactly as it is worded in the list below where one
  applies — those labels are substituted automatically afterwards.
- Write in formal policy language ("must", "shall"), addressed to the
  security/IT staff who implement and audit against this document, not to
  a generic reader.
- Do not add a discretionary qualifier ("as appropriate", "where
  feasible", "as needed", "if possible", "should consider") that the input
  requirement does not contain: a requirement stated without conditions
  stays without conditions, because a qualifier turns it into something an
  auditor cannot test. Where the input requirement carries one — frameworks
  do, e.g. "establish (and implement as needed)" — keep it exactly.
  Dropping it states an obligation stricter than the rule being cited,
  which misstates it just as badly as weakening it.
- Never state a frequency, deadline, duration or count that is not given
  in the input requirements or in the organization context below — no
  "within 5 business days", "annually", "after 30 days" of your own. Where
  the document needs a value nobody has given you, write a square-bracket
  placeholder naming the missing decision (`[Review Frequency]`,
  `[Remediation Deadline]`), the same way an undecided `[Assignment: ...]`
  value stays undecided. An invented number reads exactly as authoritative
  as the requirement beside it, and nobody has agreed to it.

Turn a set of already-synthesized, source-tagged requirement statements \
into a short, plain-language information security POLICY document for one \
organization. Unlike the Standard document these requirements also feed,
a Policy is read by the entire organization — most readers have no
compliance background and will never see a framework control ID.

Rules:
- Output portable, well-formed CommonMark markdown only: a single '#'
  document title, followed by these '##' sections in this exact order:
  Purpose, Scope, Policy Statements, Roles & Responsibilities, Exceptions,
  Related Standards, Enforcement. No Obsidian-style [[wikilinks]], no
  vault-relative-only paths.
- Purpose: 1-2 sentences, plain language, on why this policy exists.
- Scope: 1-2 sentences naming who/what it applies to.
- Policy Statements: this is the section you must compress the hardest.
  Merge the source requirements into a SHORT list of high-level,
  plain-language commitments — far fewer bullets than the number of source
  requirements you were given. Each bullet is one organizational
  commitment a non-technical employee could read once and remember, not a
  restatement of one technical control. Never cite a framework or control
  ID here. Do not shorten each source requirement 1:1 into its own bullet
  — genuinely merge related requirements together. If you find yourself
  writing more than a handful of bullets, you haven't compressed enough;
  go back and merge further.
- Roles & Responsibilities: 1-2 sentences on who owns and enforces this
  policy.
- Exceptions: 1-2 sentences on how someone requests an exception.
- Related Standards: name the Standard document given below by its title —
  this is where a reader goes for the technical specifics, and it's the
  only place framework/control traceability needs to live from here on.
- Enforcement: one sentence on the consequence of a violation.
- Never invent a specific fact (a named team, a named contact, a specific
  consequence) that isn't given to you below or in the source requirements.
  Where a detail is missing, use a square-bracket placeholder in the same
  style as vendor placeholders, e.g. `[Security Team]` or
  `[Policy Owner Title]`, rather than making one up.

- Prerequisites: access, tools, or approvals needed before starting, as a
  bullet list. Use a square-bracket placeholder (e.g. `[Access Request
  System]`) for anything not given below rather than inventing one.
- Procedure Steps: one '###' subsection per input requirement (or tightly
  related group of requirements), each containing a numbered list of
  concrete, ordered actions — who does what, in what order, using which
  tool/system — that satisfy that requirement. Every requirement in the
  input must be reflected here; do not drop, water down, or merge unrelated
  requirements together the way the Policy tier does. Preserve each
  requirement's inline source tag (e.g. `[NIST 800-53 IA-5 | GovRAMP IA-5]`) at the
  end of its subsection heading or its first step, so the document stays
  traceable back to the frameworks it was drawn from.
- A requirement tagged `[NIST AI RMF Playbook ...]` is NIST's voluntary
  suggestion, not a requirement. Write it as NIST suggesting the action
  ("NIST suggests ..."), keep its tag, and never give that sentence "must",
  "shall", "is required to" or any other obligation: this overrides the
  formal-language rule for these sentences only. If the organization adopts
  the action as its own requirement, say so in a SEPARATE sentence that does
  not carry the Playbook tag. NEVER put a Playbook tag on a heading, not even
  merged with another framework's tag: this overrides any rule that places
  tags on headings. Put it only on the "NIST suggests ..." sentence inside
  the section.
- Steps invite deadlines. Never state a frequency, deadline, duration or count that is not given
  in the input requirements or in the organization context below — no
  "within 5 business days", "annually", "after 30 days" of your own. Where
  the document needs a value nobody has given you, write a square-bracket
  placeholder naming the missing decision (`[Review Frequency]`,
  `[Remediation Deadline]`), the same way an undecided `[Assignment: ...]`
  value stays undecided. An invented number reads exactly as authoritative
  as the requirement beside it, and nobody has agreed to it.
- Where a step is vendor/tool-specific: if the organization's vendor list
  below fills that role, use that tool's actual name and its real UI/CLI
  actions where you can reasonably infer them. If not, write the role itself
  in square brackets (`[Identity Provider]`, `[Ticketing System]`) rather
  than naming a real product or inventing specific UI steps for it.
- Roles & Responsibilities: 1-2 sentences on who is authorized to perform
  these steps and who reviews/approves exceptions.
- Related Standard: name the Standard document given below by its title —
  that document is where the *why* and the full requirement text live.
- Write in direct, imperative operational language ("Open the console and
  verify...", "Set the value to..."), addressed to the practitioner
  executing the procedure, not to an auditor.
