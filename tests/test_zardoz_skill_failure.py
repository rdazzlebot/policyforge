"""A skill that raises no longer ends the shell session (#302).

`run_shell` wrapped only `read()`, so any exception a skill raised ended the
session with a traceback and lost its state -- including #294's
`UndecodableOutput`, a refusal made loud on purpose, which then took the
user's session down with it.

80's ruling: keep the session; print a refusal as its class and message; print
anything unexpected as a traceback, because it is a bug and must stay
visible; and **never print anything that reads as the command succeeding**.
Every test here drives the real loop, not `dispatch()`, because the loop is
what was missing the handler.
