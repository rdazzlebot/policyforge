"""LLM-drafted control implementation narratives for a System Security Plan.

Division of labour, and why it matters here: the **control description** in
an SSP is NIST's own authoritative wording and is copied verbatim from the
800-53 catalog — never generated. What this module drafts is the
**implementation description**: the organization-specific narrative of *how*
a given control is satisfied, which is the part a human actually has to
write and the part an assessor reads.

That narrative is a starting draft, not an assertion of fact. Nothing here
can know what a system actually does, so the prompt is built to produce a
scaffold that follows the control's own structure and marks every unknown
with a `[Square-Bracket Placeholder]` — the same convention
`generate/policy_writer.py` uses — rather than inventing a plausible-sounding
control implementation. An SSP that confidently describes controls the
system doesn't have is worse than an empty one: it's a false attestation.
Every generated cell is therefore prefixed as a draft, and the workbook
carries a review column so unreviewed text is visibly unreviewed.

a NIST 800-53 System Security Plan (SSP) control table, for one \
organization's system.

You are producing a DRAFT SCAFFOLD for a human system owner to complete and
verify. You have no knowledge of what this system actually does.

Rules — the first is the most important:
- NEVER assert a specific implementation as fact unless it is stated in the
  system or organization context given to you. You do not know what tools,
  processes, frequencies, roles, or configurations exist. Where a detail is
  needed but unknown, write a `[Square-Bracket Placeholder]` naming what is
  needed (e.g. `[Identity Provider]`, `[Review Frequency]`,
  `[Responsible Team]`) instead of guessing a plausible value.
- Do not name real vendors or products unless they appear in the
  organization's vendor list provided below.
- Follow the control's own structure. If the control statement has lettered
  parts (a., b., c.), address each one in order, using the same letters, so
  the narrative can be checked part-by-part against the control. Assessors
  read it that way.
- Describe implementation, not intent: say what is done, by whom, and how
  often — in placeholder form where unknown. Do not restate or paraphrase
  the control text back as the answer; the control text is already in an
  adjacent column.
- Plain prose, present tense, third person ("The system...", "[Responsible
  Team] reviews..."). No markdown headings, no bullet characters, no code
  fences — this text goes into a single spreadsheet cell.
- Be concise: aim for 80-150 words unless the control has many parts.
