"""What FedRAMP publishes now, and what it stopped publishing.

FedRAMP writes no control catalog of its own. Like GovRAMP it is a **profile
over NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5**: it names controls NIST already wrote, and adds
the two things the base catalog deliberately leaves open — the
organization-defined values FedRAMP has already decided, and the normative
guidance it layers on top. Those two are the whole reason to ingest a
profile, which is why `Control` keeps `parameter_values` and
`additional_requirements` apart from `control_statement`.

## This catalog is not a baseline, and must not be read as one

The important caveat, stated first because getting it wrong would misstate
somebody's scope:

**There is no FedRAMP baseline in here.** Nothing in this catalog says which
controls a Low, Moderate or High system must implement.

Until recently that selection was published as OSCAL profiles in
`GSA/fedramp-automation`, which is where a loader like this one would have
read it. That repository is gone — not archived, not moved: the URL and the
GitHub API both return 404. No official machine-readable replacement for the
Rev5 Low/Moderate/High baseline selection has been published in its place,
and a baseline reassembled from an unofficial mirror would be worse than no
baseline at all. This project's value is that a citation traces to the body
that issued it; a mirror traces to whoever made the copy.

So `Control.baseline` is left unset by this loader, on purpose. An empty
field reads as "unknown" to `ssp --baseline` and to `coverage`. A fabricated
one would read as an answer.

What FedRAMP does still publish, and what this reads, is the
**tailoring**: `fedramp-consolidated-rules.json` in `FedRAMP/rules`, which
that repository's own README calls the canonical rules dataset. Its `CTL`
section carries FedRAMP's parameter values and guidance for 79 controls.
That is a real, authoritative, useful thing — it is simply a smaller thing
than a baseline, and the summary this module returns says so in as many
words rather than letting a count of 79 be mistaken for a control selection.

## Why this loader needs the 800-53 catalog

The rules dataset carries no control text and no titles: `AC-06-01` is a
bare key whose entry is two parameter values. FedRAMP's own website renders
these pages by joining the same dataset onto the NIST catalog, and this does
what the publisher does. Without the join a generated document would cite
`AC-6(1)` and have nothing to say about it.

The join is exact — all 79 ids resolve against the bundled Rev 5 catalog,
which is itself at 5.2.0, the revision FedRAMP's control pages name. Ids are
normalized on the way in: FedRAMP writes `AC-06-01`, zero-padded and
dash-separated, where this codebase and OSCAL write `AC-6(1)`. The
identifier *is* the join key between a profile and the catalog it profiles,
so a catalog written in the source's own spelling would crosswalk to
nothing.

## Certification classes are not impact levels

Two controls (IA-5 and SA-9(5)) carry `varies_by_class`, whose keys are `b`,
`c` and `d`. These are FedRAMP **Certification Classes** — "the category of
assurance that a cloud service offering supplies to federal government
customers … increasing from minimal assurance at Class A to significant
assurance at Class D". They are the 2026 successor to the Low/Moderate/High
axis, and they are not the same thing: a class is an assurance category, not
a FIPS 199 categorisation of the system.

They are also not a selection. `varies_by_class` says this control's
guidance and parameter values read differently depending on the class
pursued; it does not say the control is required at one class and not
another. IA-5 varies only its guidance — the NIST Digital Identity
Guidelines level rises with the class — while SA-9(5) varies its parameter
values, deciding `sa-09.05_odp.02` for Class D and leaving it open for Class
C. Rendering both under a heading that names the class keeps the two facts
visible at once: an assessor reads the line that applies to them, and nobody
mistakes the presence of three classes for a three-tier baseline.
